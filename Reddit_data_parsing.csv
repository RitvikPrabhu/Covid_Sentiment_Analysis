"A friend reached out for help with drinking, but I don’t know what to do",1,jzixou,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jzixou/a_friend_reached_out_for_help_with_drinking_but_i/,9,1606171818.0,"My ex, who is a close friend now, came over last night super drunk, confessed to very heavy drinking, and asked for help because she thinks she needs to go to detox in order to stop. She’s never done anything like this, she usually tries to hide it from me. She was wasted and couldn’t talk about anything serious so I just gave her a safe place to be while she slept it off on my couch, then she went home. 

Drinking and substance abuse isn’t new. We went through her benzo taper when we were dating (that was brutal) and broke up largely because she wasn’t up for really working on drinking. Her job that she loves and her stability are at risk, I’ve seen her drinking during work while working from home under covid lockdown and I know she isn’t safe.

In my experience, all I can do for her is love her, be honest about what I’m seeing, and support her decisions in the right direction. We’ve talked about options lots of times and she doesn’t really listen to me. She just hasn’t been ready. 

If this is an open door to actually help, I’d like to do what I can, but I know from experience that over-trying to help is real and exhausting/heartbreaking. Do you have any ideas for ways to support her even though she’s the only one who can make the hard choices? I’m afraid of missing an opportunity.

Other details: She did AA years ago and is absolutely not into it, but is open to other models. She uses alcohol to manage anxiety and ptsd. She recently lost her beloved brother to cancer. There are good things going on, but being sober right now is going to open up a whole lot of pain + isolation with covid.",2020-11-23 17:50:18
Seeking advice/reassurance,1,k15viq,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/k15viq/seeking_advicereassurance/,3,1606383970.0,I’m at 23 yr old F. Had a great life before quarantine but really struggling now. I have a decent job but working from home day to day has taken its toll and now I and so bored/unstimulated that it’s hard to see how life will return to normal and I’ve been drinking heavily to pass the time. I guess I’m looking for reassurance or a fiend who will tell me everything will pass and get better. Will I be able to come back from this?

Health Effects? Need Insight,2,k0y26k,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/k0y26k/health_effects_need_insight/,12,1606358650.0,"Hi all, first time poster. Just a quick question. I know you all aren't doctors and everybody's bodies react differently. But I'm 31 and I was pretty much mostly a Thursday-Saturday drinker throughout my 20s and I still pretty much stick to those days and have zero alcohol any other days unless its a special occasion. My intake is usually about 8 light beers or so and a couple shots of fireball on Thursdays. And on Fridays and Saturdays id say I consume probably 10-12 light beers and 2-3 shots each night. So roughly 40 drinks a week. I never really drank that much at home until quarantine,  used to be mostly at bars. 

Let me also say I workout 5 days a week and have for years, also take vitamins and supplements,  drink a lot of water, and for the most part watch what I eat during the week.  What are your thoughts for my long term health outlook? I feel fine right now but I tend to be a hypochondriac and worry about long term health effects of everything.  But im really not interested in quitting drinking,  it relaxes me and there's not much else to do where I live, everyone seems to drink a decent amount. Thoughts?",2020-11-25 21:44:10

They both knew I drank some, but not nearly as much as I lead on. As in having a couple drinks with dinner and 10 after everyone goes to bed for about a year now. I’ve been unemployed for the better part of this year and have used up what money I had, as well as taking money from my mom, which I confessed to her today. Got the whole “not mad, just disappointed” talk from her. I find most of my happiest moments as of late come from drinking and that already seems like a bad sign. I know how out of touch with reality I’ve become, how irritable, anxious, and depressed I’ve been especially in the last year, even before Covid. And while I want to quit, I also don’t, which brings me here. I like drinking and I like the feelings I have when I do drink, but I also know how it’s affecting my life and those around me. I know I’m able to limit myself regardless of the environment I’m in, but I often choose to keep drinking because I enjoy the sensation, hence suggesting the physical dependency and why I’m struggling to stop. For the first time in a year I feel like I’m actually caring about the concerns of others and for myself having admitted out loud my addiction. I guess the question is, how do I transfer my addiction toward something healthy? How do you start a “day 1” without drinking, especially when it’s been your constant for over a year?",2020-11-26 06:42:17

You are not your mind. 

I was inspired to write to you by something much bigger than myself. If I can provide a spark that ignites a fire of illumination in your own life then I have succeeded. I don’t know you personally, I just know that we are all interconnected and that we need each other’s help. 

In order to meet me halfway and do your part please keep an open mind when considering what I have to say. If after careful consideration you find it of no use, I appreciate you taking the time to read it. We can all use fresh perspectives simply because we don’t know what we don’t know. 

I want you, my fellow humans, to wake up to the reality, just as I did, that alcohol is deadening your physical and spiritual senses to the point that you are not living life to your fullest potential. This you instinctively already know. And that is the entire point of this. You have to honor your own instinct and intuition.  

My message is simple, but takes a bit of explanation to grasp the concept so here we go. 


The message---
 
In my very humble and unsophisticated opinion I believe that there is no place in the human body for alcohol, and that use in moderation, although lessening the negative impact, is too much. In other words, you are playing Russian-Roulette with, at minimum addiction, or even worse, a life squandered by undiscovered, or untapped potential.

But who am I to make such an absolute and unyielding statement you may ask? I am nobody, I just want to share my unique perspective so that others can plug it into their own psyche so that they have yet another tool in their own wheelhouse to wake up to the reality of the truth.

The path I am are walking now is centered on the present, I had to forgive myself for the decisions that led to here and now. Without boring you with the minutia of every detail of my experience, I feel it adequate to say that, at some point I allowed alcohol to seduce. I was temporally blind to the damage it was causing while using. Regardless of where you fall on your addiction spectrum, I appreciate and understand that our experiences vary wildly. I also appreciate that the severity of dependence will vary greatly on this message board, but the goal should be the same, to cut ties with your dependence on alcohol and reclaim your life, to reclaim your spirit that is being suppressed by alcohol.

I think there is an inherent misconception often portrayed in regards to the mechanisms of alcohol dependency. I often hear of those that are predisposed to addiction, and that their genetic trigger will hasten all types of addiction and substance. I do not dispute the genetic causation, I just pose that we are all genetically prone to addiction, some of us ease into in it more subtly than others.

We, as humans are amazing self-illusionist, to the degree, that we have the capacity to perform all assortments of sophisticated trickery on ourselves, one of the greatest, is that we are able to deceive ourselves though internal dialogue to such a degree that we can avoid the realty of the most obvious truths, by simply not having the courage to face those truths when they present themselves. I would venture to say that you know exactly the point that I am trying to convey. You know without doubt that drinking alcohol is bad for you. You may be in a place where you are not fully aware to what degree it is bad, but you instinctually know. Therein lies the rub, if we know that we are hurting ourselves on a very regular basis then why do we do it? You are not flawed, you are not at the mercy of your mind, which just so happens to be a professional enabler. Consider that it could just boil down to that we may not understand or have the correct insight to counteract our own mind’s ability to control us. I hope to provide a spark of that insight, or at least how that insight which has worked for/on me. You don’t have to suffer.

It may sound a bit counterintuitive to suggest that your mind is at the center of the problem, because after all, if it is your mind controlling you then how on earth can you battle and conquer your own mind? Understanding and applying the answer to this question is fundamental to your healing, and is something that I had to learn the hard way in order to pass that major obstacle. Without sounding too farfetched and in keeping with many great philosophers throughout human history, I will suggest this one simple concept that I believe is absolutely true and vital for you to understand in order for your ultimate success.

You are not your mind.

Your mind and your consciousness are two completely different aspects of you. Your mind is often a swirling jumble of rapid fire thoughts and input from your environment. Whereas your consciousness is much a deeper aspect of your psyche that is more or less your main operating system. Our mind is constantly battling with our sub-conscious for control. If you can separate the two and come to understand that your mind can be quieted so that your consciousness can consider the truth, then this is a fantastic jumping off point for your recovery and subsequent wellbeing. Your life, no matter how chaotic can benefit from this simple truth. You can control yourself if you can sit back and subjectively observe that much of the time your mind is hijacked by emotional insecurities, emotional immaturity, and programming from the “social norms” of society. Couple this with the fast pace and stresses of our modern society, it is no wonder that alcohol abuse and the associated heath issues are systemic in modern society.

Let me suggest a thought experiment that you can do right this second that will highlight this. I want you to stop and think about how your continued alcohol use effects your life, your family, your job, your hobbies, and your heath. How is alcohol stealing your time, your money, your well-being? How do you feel when you wake up in in the middle of the night with a pounding headache and hate yourself for having done it again. How many times have you driven drunk or buzzed, how about with your or other’s children in the car. How would you feel if a child ran into the street and was killed by a vehicle that you operated? Could you justify having even one drink in your system. How do you feel about yourself when you go to work with the brain fog of continued and long term alcohol use? Do not let up until you flush out every negative aspect of your dependence. I want you to really face the music? I want you to face the hard truths that bubble up from your sub-consciousness. Don’t deny anything, expose the most painful truths to yourself without filter. You should absolutely refuse to allow your mind to justify, excuse, or lessen the severity of your pain. When you learn to control your petulant irrational mind you will begin to feel your own power and the amazing potential for personal growth in all aspects of your life. When you do this on a regular basis you will be amazed how often your mind wants to jump in and excuse and or justify your destructive behavior.

This trick of silencing the mind can be applied to all aspects of your life. If it sounds familiar to you, it should, this is essentially what mediation practitioners do, but you don’t have to delve into cross-legged chanting for hours to experience the benefits of controlling your mind, you just have to simply notice the minds internal dialogue and work to understand that a lot of time it is just unnecessary noise. You don’t have to follow the instruction, justification, fear, rationalization or anything it offers up. The mind can be very troublesome. But you know that already.

An uncontrolled or unchecked mind is most often preoccupied with the most ridiculous and asinine thoughts that are often of no use and are often times actually detrimental to your physical wellbeing, spiritual wellbeing and transcendental growth. Our ancestor’s minds helped to hone their survival skills by constantly scanning the environment for danger. In addition and as part of that survival we needed to get along with our tribe to survive the harsh climate, inhospitable environment, and the constant search and battles for resources to survive. For the most part modern society has unburdened us with much of our ancestors actual struggle to survive, however, in spite of our technological, psychological, and scientific discoveries, we have yet to have more than the most rudimentary understating of our own mind’s neural networks. 

Our mind’s ability to keep us alive is still very much relevant and necessary, however, it can be a bit overactive in a great many people. Including myself. With that being said our mind has yet to discover that it no longer needs constant hypervigilance to keep us alive. Modern society meets most of our basic needs but our mind hasn’t gotten the memo yet, so therefor it trudges along the same way it did for thousands of years always looking for threats, acting on fear, emotion and insecurities.

Unwittingly or otherwise corporations, through advertisement, hack our minds basic need to please the tribe. Take for instance, due to our current topic, the alcohol industries’ advertisement campaigns. They simply have actors display people in groups smiling at one another, sometimes scantily clad, but always just people having fun. They wrap it up, throw it out there, and we eat it up. Why is that? It is not some sophisticated marketing algorithm. They are appealing to your very basic lizard brain.

Alcohol=Fun.

Eventually as in our own society, we buy into the lies it and it becomes an inherent part of our culture. In your past, as a societally programmed drinker, did you ever encounter someone that flat out told you “I don’t drink”? Somewhere in your mind you wanted to know the reasoning behind that person’s decision. Just that phrase sounds a bit alien to our culture. You probably assumed as I did that that person was flawed in some manner, that they were a prude or scared to drink, that they couldn’t “handle their alcohol”. Maybe you thought that they just didn’t understand how much fun it is to drink? What is wrong with that person?

Using the analytical, truth seeking, powerful part of your psyche, I bet you could sit down and list a great deal of reasons that anyone including yourself should consider sobriety. I have come to realize that people that don’t drink are not flawed or boring individuals, they are in fact, a lot of times exception individuals who have had the courage and forethought to break away from the herd. While we have been busy diluting our existence with dulled senses, they are in fact the ones that are living life in a much more productive, and rewarding way. They have unplugged from the hive mind, and therefore are able to see the truth behind the veil.

Don’t take my stance on the matter that I would have our society outlaw alcohol, just the opposite. You are masters of your own destiny and should be free to make and live with any decision that you make. Draconian laws and a nanny state will never make the world a better place. It is the highest order of hypocrisy for the state to legalize or illegalize any substance based on the amount of tax revenue it receives. I only mention this to point out the cigarette and alcohol industry are prime examples of how society can be taken advantage of through targeted addiction campaigns. Are you starting to see the picture? We need to outwit our hive minds, in order to transcend our basic existence.

Do you know someone, or do you yourself watch the news on a very consistent basis? How about social media platforms that constantly echo a perceived threat to your own particular belief system. It is not difficult to do, we all join groups or tribes even virtual that exalt our “side” and conversely warn of the threat from the other “side. Soon enough you only seek out or are exposed to content that it’s biased to confirm your believe. Does this constant information flow keep you safe and or happy? Does it contributed to your wellbeing?

Do you know why you subject yourself to it constantly? We can go back and talk about our minds primitive job of constantly scanning for danger. By watching the news, which is, as far as I’m concerned, electronic junk food for the brain. Your mind receives a dopamine hit when you are scared, angry, and excited. Our minds, once again are concerned with survival of the tribe. When we listen to constant bad news we are feeding that very archaic need to watch out for danger. Once we understand how easily we are manipulated though our lizard brain and our emotions then we can counter that with a conscious effort to quiet that part of your mind, to introspectively seek the truth, and make profound changes on our life.

Next time someone or something makes you angry, instead of acting angry in turn and diving into a conflict, consider doing this instead. Uncouple your conscious mind from your mind and pretend that your consciousness is a passive observer to your reactive and often irrational mind. You may be able to stop your mind and your adrenal system from hijacking you. If you can sit back as a spectator so to speak and try to determine if your mind is really overreacting, or is this an actual threat. You may have absolutely no reason to converse with that person. Trying to prove your point or answering for a perceived insult is not justification enough. It is substantially more beneficial to converse with yourself. You can just move on. This will leave the individual perplexed and again make you an exceptional individual. You have control over your mind you just have to understand its basic motivations. You will know when and if action is necessary, this is not to suggest that you be so passive that you avoid confrontation, just that you may try to lessen the degree in which your emotional brain orchestrates the interaction.

Sobriety -

My first attempt at sobriety failed because I guess that I did not understand the mental mechanics at play, that is not so say that my subsequent attempt will not fail, but each day sober is a gift that I will strive not to lose sight of. Previously I spent a year mourning the loss of alcohol and concerning myself with what everyone else was doing. Holidays were spent on the verge of tears because, I felt as if I was missing out, and torturing myself. I was in a battle with my self-control vs. my lust for alcohol. This internal conflict was substantial because I didn’t have the tools to deal with it. There were a lot of wonderful aspects of sobriety that I cherished, such as evenings with my children whereas before I was not available. It was as if the world was open to me after 6 P.M. There are so many pictures of me living life during that year, and I have crystal clear memories of the great times I had. My emotions, when not mourning alcohol were powerful and complete, not childish, but childlike in their wonderment of the world around me. But I hadn’t spent enough time in the dark yet. It was a little over a year before my lizard brain rationalized that drinking a beer on the way home was a good idea. I earned it right? It was as if I had never stopped, the cycle picked up exactly where I left it. When you feel like you failed but don’t know why it takes a toll on you emotionally. So you go ahead and have that drink so that you don’t have to deal with having that hard look for yourself. My mind won that time.

Judge if you will but recently I have had a type of existential push into enlightenment and spirituality that I don’t really understand myself but am nonetheless wholeheartedly grateful for. This was not developed through therapy, organized religion, drugs, support groups or by speaking with any guru on the subject. I can only say that the universe was waiting for my mind to develop into one that could receive the message. I am a lifelong atheist from my early years questioning everything about my parent’s faith. I didn’t and don’t believe in God in the biblical sense. I believed that when I died that I would decay into worm dirt. I was ok with that, or so I had always thought. Now, I believe in God, not as the bearded white man, but as the interconnected collective universe that we are all part of. With this revelation, and with what was once a roadblock to me spiritually, a curiosity superhighway has opened before me, and I’m enjoying the trip. My boozed mind could not begin to comprehend it. I will write more on that if anyone is interested.

The universe told me, “there is something that I have to show you, but your mind must be clear to see it”, and bang, like the snapping of fingers, my addiction or the belief rather that I was addicted was gone. Then the healing began. Prior to this revelation and gift, I had this rumbling in my brain that was steering me toward the idea that the main purpose of my existence was to treat people ethically to the extent that I make the world a better place for having been here. Think my ripple of existence should do much more good than harm. Drinking daily would not help to serve this purpose.
The only reason I relayed the spiritual side of my journey is to relay the following, use any assistance that you can, even the divine, if it helps you to break the cycle of dependence. It is that important.
I stopped drinking instantly, it was not planned. For the first week I was exhausted, I couldn’t think straight, I was irritable and probably an ass to be around. It was as if all of my physical and mental energy was put toward healing my brain. I suddenly understood that I was not my mind, that I could control it, and that I was not going to drink.

Please consider getting professional help if you are severely addicted. You may need professional medical assistance while you are doing your part. You know what you need to do.

For those of you that have read that the brain fog lifts, this is profoundly true, although it is so much more than mere brain fog. I have come to understand just how substantially compromised and degraded that my mind and body was. It has been only a month, and I can promise you that it is not anyone’s imagination that their brain comes out of a fog. When drinking, and especially on a regular basis, the effects of alcohol last much longer than the initial drunk, and subsequent hangover. Your brain is anesthetized to the point that you are, for lack of a better word, stupid. You don’t realize it at the time however, any activity you have to do that requires concentration is greatly diminished by your soaked brain. This could be a direct result that you are not getting quality sleep. I had fooled myself into thinking that I was an individual that needed more than eight hours of sleep a day, when in fact that I was passing out in the evening, “sleeping” all night and waking up feeling like I hadn’t slept at all. I just fooled myself into thinking that I was not a morning person. The fact is you don’t sleep well when you drink on a regular basis. Now I get home, play with the kids, workout, take late night walks, stay up as late as I want without being nearly as tired in the morning and am unbelievably more competent and capable with a clear mind. Just writing this would have been an unsurmountable task just two months ago. I didn’t have ADHD, I just had a brain that was constantly soaked in or recovering from alcohol and did not have the mental capacity to concentrate.

There are so many more benefits that I can delve into, but I think that at have adequately relayed my point, which is, you are capable of so much more than your chaotic mind suggests and distracts you from. I sincerely wish everyone the best of luck in your journey, in turn, please wish me the same luck as we are all connected and I know that I will need yours and my resolve in the future. I won’t say don’t be discouraged by your failures, do, and learn from them, learn from the pain, without darkness there is no light. Maybe at the moment you have had enough of that dark to appreciate and hold onto to the light.

I wrote this in one sitting so please excuse my grammatical errors. When I type like this it is a passionate expression of my ideas, and I may not catch my errors, the message is what matters most.

You are loved",2020-11-25 18:45:29

I went through a awful phase with alcohol where I’d over drink and I truly regret that I got a DWI at 16 and drove into a ditch, (it was really my abusive boyfriend at the time yes I’m gay I was trying to I get away from a bad situation) however my lawyer got me out of rehab (I did spend 7 days in rehab when it was originally 180 days) and I took that super close. However, I’m now in college and have been so depressed, I’m finally dealing with my mother leaving us and me taking responsibly of the household and I just feel so awful because my college career was robbed, and my father is drinking a lot but it really makes me question is this normal or am I a alcoholic?

I've been reading this subreddit for a while now because of my father. He has been drinking on and off ever since I can remember him. He stopped drinking for many years at some point but relapsed afterwards. Lately he has been drinking as if he doesn't care to live any more. We have a great family and no other issues in my family. He does not have much to be stressed about except some of his cousins passing away due to covid. 

We have tried rehab and spiritual and all sorts of meds but nothing is helping so far. 

I know that he has lost control and cannot stop on his own . I think of his addiction as a disease. I really want to help him but don't know how. I just feel sad and guilty that I cant help him. 

Has someone have a similar situation or have been in that place themselves where they were addicted and how they solved it ? What are some effective options out there ?",2020-11-24 06:00:35

That being said I'm 33 years old and for the last year I have been stone cold sober by my own free will. the drinking started around 15 or 16 and was really, really bad in my mid-twenties and then kind of cooled off in my late twenties but was still kind of spiking at times. From 30 to 32 I would go on and off. there were times when I had maybe three drinks in a year over that period but I wasn't completely sober, obviously. 

This year was my year though in spite of all of the challenges globally. I never used quarantine boredom as an excuse to get hammered. I'm pretty proud of that because I spend most of my time being lonely, my biggest trigger. 

So what have I accomplished in my year of sobriety? I have lost 55 lb, gotten a nicer car (sweet ride), gotten a nicer place to live that is larger, although I don't really like my job I got more hours which means more money, and I'm just overall clean, organized, efficient and the complete opposite of chaotic, how used to be.

It's so hard to ignore the presence of alcohol in the house, it's embarrassing, I feel like garbage.  
The first thing he does when he gets home from work is make a stiff drink. When he pours a shot, he pours two and holds one up to me. (I don't think he does it maliciously). He can define alcoholism but is convinced he doesn't fit the bill because he's not drinking straight liquor and isn't passing out every night. I can define alcoholism, and I know I am an alcoholic, even if I'm not passing out every night.

We agreed that he should move out by April, but I feel like I can't keep myself from taking a beer or pouring a drink when its right in front of me. Ugh I'm struggling you guys.",2020-11-23 18:17:24
Alcoholic asked to social event at bar,3,jxf2z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jxf2z5/alcoholic_asked_to_social_event_at_bar/,5,1605861732.0,"Long story short, my coworker of many years has asked me and some work friends to go to a bar since it's her last day. I can't say no since it could ruin my work life. I'm not sure if everyone there is a drinker so I may not even be pressured to drink. A few of the employees don't seem like heavy drinkers and some of them do. I imagine some of them will just get sodas and some will get beer or liquor. I don't think I will be pressured but I'm not entirely sure.

I've only hit my first week of sobriety after many years of drinking and I like the way I feel. I'm so proud of myself and I don't even crave a drink at this point. The idea of alcohol at this point makes me feel sick and anxious. I'm worried that if I even have 1 beer it'll undo my progress I've made and the addiction will come back.

Any tips for a quick way out of drinking? I don't want to tell them I'm an alcoholic but I don't want to give off the vibe that I'm hiding from it either.",2020-11-20 03:42:12

My (32M) wife (30F) drinks too much. Can I tell her doctor?,3,jyqy9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jyqy9p/my_32m_wife_30f_drinks_too_much_can_i_tell_her/,19,1606054722.0,"Hi all. I also posted this to r/relationship_advice but I feel like I could get better help here. This is where I'm at:

My wife drinks too much. Her drinking picked up after we got married two years ago. It's really picked up since we've been under quarantine and home all the time. She has at least 5-6 drinks per day. On bad days she has 10+ drinks. I've not seen her take a single day off drinking since we've been home full-time in early March. She drinks at whatever hour she wants, including the mornings. Sometimes she has trouble sleeping and stays up drinking after I've gone to bed. I handle the recycling, and it's a lot of bottles. It's also not cheap.

She does enough work for her job, but she definitely could do more (we are in very similar jobs so I know based on my work). She never does anything risky like get behind the wheel; she just loves to drink at home for whatever reason. If she's sad, mad, celebratory, stressed, bored, or just unwinding, she drinks. She used to try to hide it, but after I found out she now does it openly. She partially justifies it by pointing to celebrities who post selfies with glasses of wine at whatever hour and blame it on #quarantine, but she's a regular person with a regular job who can't just drink all the time. She drinks too much, and it has to be bad for her health.

It's overwhelmingly the biggest cause of our fights. I can't talk to her about it. If I ask her to cut back for any reason, she gets extremely upset. At best, she'll get pissed and say she'll come to me if she thinks she has a problem (and then usually won't talk to me for a day or more). More often, she accuses me of being ""controlling"" or not respecting her as an adult if I talk about her drinking. I try not to bring it up, but I'm not perfect and I do try to talk about it occasionally. We tried couple's therapy, and she flat out lied to our therapist about how much she drinks, and it led to some really terrible fights (the therapist wasn't helpful because they kept saying, ""I'm not there; I don't know how much she drinks,"" whenever we'd tell her two different things about her drinking). I think that we'd be in great shape if she cut back -- she's my best friend and we can definitely thrive together -- but she is so attached to alcohol.

We're both in individual therapy, and I sense she isn't honest with her therapist about drinking. Our therapists have spoken, and my therapist intimated that her therapist is unaware of the extent of her drinking. Last session, my therapist kind of blurted out a question and asked if I'd considered talking to her primary care physician about her drinking, and I never even thought that was a possibility. She doesn't have a PCP, but she has an OB/GYN appointment in about two weeks, and it's a new doctor because she's on a new insurance policy. Part of me thinks this is a bad idea, but should I find a way to communicate to her new doctor that she drinks a lot in hope the doctor will talk to her about it and maybe shed light on what it's doing to her health (including running some tests to see whether she's already hurting herself)? How would I even do this? It strikes me as a bad idea but my wife is very intelligent and would listen to a credible expert, so I think a doctor could communicate this message the most effectively. Part of me thinks this is my best hope, short of my wife having a serious crisis.

Anticipating some of your feedback:

No, I'm not leaving her. I made vows, and those included ""sickness"" and ""for worse."" Addiction falls under that umbrella in my book.

I agree this seems like a bad idea, but the only reason I'm considering it is because my therapist mentioned it. I've tried to talk to her family about it, but her parents are somewhere between ""hands off"" and ""heads in the sand."" My wife gets very upset if I talk to other people about any problems we're having, so I have to be diplomatic.

Yes, I know about Al-Anon, but it's kind of hard to join a support group when we are home and together all the time. I will continue to read and educate myself, and I know that she has to want to stop drinking. I'm just wondering whether talking to her doctor could spur her to want to stop drinking.

I'm not trying to control her or to make her feel awful. I just know she's drinking a ridiculously unhealthy amount, and we both want a family some day. I'd love if she could just cut way back and be able to take days off.

We aren't planning to have kids right now but would like kids in the future. 

tl;dr: My wife drinks too much. It's the biggest problem in our marriage. Should I try to communicate to her new doctor that she abuses alcohol so that the doctor could try to talk to her about it? If so, how do I even do this?",2020-11-22 09:18:42

My partner is increasingly struggling with their alcohol consumption and it’s affecting their physical and mental health. They would describe themselves as a highly functioning alcoholic. 

It’s used as a stress release mainly and while they’re aware of the impact it’s having on their life and mine, they are struggling to find other coping mechanisms. We are in the UK so lockdown is an issue, plus you know, a general pandemic, weather, just a lack of options. I’m trying as much as I can. We’ve recently had a long conversation about the whole thing. 

My question is, does anyone have any good resources or books on alcohol dependency, how it’s used in stressful situations and the impact it has on your well-being? I think currently, they could give it a break and see how their life changes for the better by moderating. But I can’t help but worry it will spiral if not addressed properly.

Need advice,4,jwgtii,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jwgtii/need_advice/,8,1605738863.0,"Today was supposed to be my 3rd day sober but is again day one...

I (31F) have had unhealthy relationship with alcohol since I started drinking at the age of 14 or so. I've never drank just to enjoy a drink or a cold beer in the summer - I've always done it with the sole purpose of getting wasted.

First it was because of my shitty childhood and trying to deal or rather forget the trauma. Then it became a coping mechanisms for terrible social anxiety. After that I was in uni and getting drunk is what pretty much everyone is doing, right? Then I got depressed and, yes although I know now that alcohol is actually a depressant, I used it as a way to forget my feelings for a bit and just chill. Anyway, there was always something happening that would make me drink. Or so I thought. It took me years to stop making excuses and realise I have a problem.

In fact, I realised it was a problem about a week ago. I spent the last few weeks getting drunk every single night. And right now there's absolutely no ""reason"" for that. I'm healthy, quite happy with my job, in a great relationship, life is good (well, if we forget about Covid for a second). And still!

Surprisingly, my drinking has never affected my work and I am perfectly capable of getting up in the morning and go on with my day. Even more strange for me is that my hangovers are not as bad as they used to be. What started worrying me though is that my liver hurts. A lot. It started a few months ago and I'd feel it only if I'm sitting in an uncomfortable position or something but now I feel it almost all the time. Sitting, standing - doesn't matter.

I really don't want to get myself into a hospital or worse so I thought I'd just quit. Turns out quitting drinking is harder that quitting smoking and drugs combined. That's based on my personal experience, I suppose it's different for everyone. 

I really need an advice! I have no idea what to do. How do you deal with the urges in the first few days/weeks? Does it get better?

P. S. Sorry for the rant, I guess I needed to vent a bit.",2020-11-18 17:34:23
One Year without a drop after 20 years of Alcoholism,194,jx3v45,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jx3v45/one_year_without_a_drop_after_20_years_of/,20,1605825707.0,"This day one year ago I woke up hungover and ashamed. I am 53 (F) with a long history of abusing alcohol. I have been arrested for DUI, crashed my car,  missed family events,  been to rehab, on and off antibuse. I have been in and out of AA.  I use to drink Vodka first thing in the morning to feel normal. 

I am a mother of two - my children have been me drunk and passed out. They have had to come see me in court. They have had to deal with their mother disappearing for days. 

My husband has had to go pick me up from the hospital after I collapsed in public. I cheated on my husband as I found others to enable my drinking. 

So today I am so proud of myself. One year of not drinking even through a frigging pandemic. So how did I manage a year ?  The last ten years it was no drinking for 2 or 3 months then BANG - binge , hungover, guilt, shame, promises to stop. 

1. I got honest with myself - when I was in rehab a doctor told me that my brain lies to me. As a somewhat intelligent person - I have a post graduate degree in engineering. How can my brain lie ? Believe me , your addiction doesn’t care about how smart you think you are. 

2. I stopped making promises - I started breaking it down to day by day. If I just didn’t drink today I would be good. 

3. I made my health my priority. Stuck to a sleep schedule. Exercise everyday even just a walk. Eat properly. Have desert everyday. 

4. Most importantly I took the time to think about my life. I really don’t want to die. Even after being in the hospital to get my stomach pumped I didn’t stop drinking. I finally realized that I want to live and alcohol was going to kill me. 

5. I made changes in my life. I realized I was sick and tired of alcohol’s merry-go-round. I admitted what wasn’t was working in my life, put aside my ego and made changes . 

Everyday I am thankful I didn’t drink. 

Keep trying if you are struggling. Be kind to yourself. I had to make a conscious decision to be happy. And alcohol was making me miserable. 

Today my husband and I are still together and better than we have been since we first started dating 34 years ago. My children are adults but they now have a supportive mother. 

Please be kind to yourself.",2020-11-19 17:41:47
My boyfriend is a functioning alcoholic. And it’s ruining me but I’m afraid to leave,11,ju3bnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ju3bnf/my_boyfriend_is_a_functioning_alcoholic_and_its/,13,1605395352.0,"When my boyfriend and I first met, it was sparks. But I should of seen the signs. We met at his dorm room and he was having a small party, he was drunk, shirtless and signing “Call Me Maybe”. From there, he was polite, a gentleman and took me around the city we lived in on amazing dates. I quickly met his family and he met mine. 8 years late I look back and try to reason why I didn’t see the signs.

He has the most extreme of extreme social anxiety, he would drink before classes especially when it involved presenting. He would drink while around my family, around his extended family and around any friends. He tried medication for his social anxiety, it didn’t work and ended up giving him extreme side effects. He says alcohol has been the only thing that makes life livable. He’s not depressed though. Alcoholism runs in his family. 

He’s been joking lately about mixing pills while drinking and often has days where he’s 20 shots deep (I know I didn’t believe it either until I witnessed it several times). He still functions like normal when he drinks except that I’ve been noticing him saying he can’t live without it. I do notice without access to alcohol he’s quickly agitated, shaking, and feels like his entire body aches. He says even before he drank as a kid he would feel like this. 

We have our issues. He never ever comes to visit me, he opts to stay near his family. My emotionally needs aren’t met, just say “drink it off”. I’ve been more isolated during this pandemic than ever and my depression is crushing. I get he can’t visit me all the time and often works long hours since he works at a private school with boarders. But I went to grad school, worked at a start up and traveled 3 hours each way on the weekend to see him.

I’m scared because he gave me herpes (he had it before and I never thought about it, until I got it myself) and now I’m truly scared I’ll leave him and never find anyone who will love me. He’s made me feel truly unloveable during fights and knows exactly what to do to strike me to my core and destroy me. I’m now isolated, no friends around me during this pandemic and still far away from my boyfriend traveling an hour each way to see him. 

I love this fun, lovable man to the core of my being. I know he loves his alcohol more than me, in fact he told me that before. But 8 years later, I feel like I got none of my needs met. He says he got a job that was more stable for me since he was out of work for 3 years... feels like manipulation to me.

Husbands drinking habits,8,jvdj8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jvdj8k/husbands_drinking_habits/,19,1605584576.0,"I’m worried about my husbands drinking habits. He’s been drinking since he was 16, and it’s gotten to the point where he drinks every single day. During the week he has at least 6 beers when he gets home and 8-10 if he doesn’t work. Usually he does not drink liquor. His father struggles from alcoholism which has put a huge strain on their relationship and my mother suffers from alcoholism as well, so we’ve both witness first hand how it affects relationships. I’ve talked to him several times about it and he denies it being an issue since he’s able to pay his bills and go to work everyday. I suggest maybe only drinking on the weekends or if we are a watching a game or maybe seeing a therapist (he suffers from anxiety and depression) and he thinks I’m being controlling or over reacting. I try not to make it into an argument, more as that I’m worried about his health and mental well being. He also seems to be more moody and instigates fights when he is drinking. I don’t know how to handle this. A few months ago he was going through a rough patch, I wasn’t able to physically be there for him because he lives in Canada and I live in the US and the borders are closed d/t Covid. Families are allowed to visit but that would require taking 2 weeks off work to quarantine, which I did in September (before his rough patch) and then I’m currently staying in Canada for a bit d/t the circumstances.  Any way it resulted into him wanting to divorce and him drinking liquor every day and going to the bars and wandering the streets wasted. He was going through a lot at the time as was I, but the whole situation made me realize the drinking is starting to be a big problem. I know at the end of the day it’s up to him. How can I handle this better? Or how can I give him the help he needs. Thanks In advance.",2020-11-16 22:42:56

My mum was a severe functioning alcoholic my entire life, I’m 24 and had never really met my mum until 22 when she finally went into rehab. I was raised around police visits, suicide attempts, violent outbursts, mental breakdowns, delusions, and parenting my mum. My life changed when she got sober, while I’m still mentally stunted and a bit messed up from before having an actual mum has been incredible, it was the strangest feeling meeting her sober. 

It’s been 2 years and she’s had an incredibly traumatic experience at work (it involved seeing a 2 week old corpse) which is nowhere in her job description and something she isn’t trained for. I noticed the faint smell of wine on her breath the other day but she didn’t seem drunk. While she was out I checked her old hiding place and found an empty bottle of port. I have no idea what to do, my oldest brother is having a child and told my mum he’d completely cut her off if she started drinking again because he doesn’t want to expose his kid to what we were. 

I can’t go back to how things were, my mental health was terrible and I wouldn’t survive another round of it. I’m temporarily living here due to covid and cant stay with my siblings as I have a temp job near my mums house and I have to walk. How do I help? Rehab 2 years ago isn’t paid off yet so there’s no way she can afford to go back in and Im not sure what to do. Any time I’ve brought up concern in the past has led to her spiralling and my worry is that because she thinks I don’t know she’s having to go slow, but if the secrets out and there’s no use hiding it she’ll down a few bottles. 

I’ve done this dance my whole life and I know she’s the only one that can make her stop but if we go back to how it was 2 years ago it’s probably going to kill me, and I mean that in a very literal sense and short of quitting my job and taking to the streets I’m not sure what else I can do.",2020-11-18 16:02:17
Brain Fog,1,jwehp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jwehp4/brain_fog/,7,1605729407.0,"Hey!

Until this latest quitting attempt (taking various recommended supplements and getting back into intensive exercise) I'd been drinking quasi-regularly for ease-of-thought for writing, maybe 15 units a day (cider, therefore high-sugar, possibly cause of inflammation et al.) for a week every month, alongside social stuff.

Weirdly I seem to think considerably better in low ambient temperature, whereas the smallest amount of caffeine shuts my brain off pretty much completely (alongside a general hypersensitivity to stimulants).

Brain fog also worsened considerably after bingeing for several months whilst on anti-depressants (venlafaxine) several years ago.

Apart from perhaps occasional bouts of hypomania I don't appear to be exhibiting any withdrawal symptoms.

Does this sound familiar to anybody? Especially unfamiliar? Does anybody have any advice? Do you have any questions?

I recognise this isn't a medical forum, but doctors have thus far been of very little help, and I thought it might be a good idea to draw on collective experience.

Much obliged,

Recent Issues,2,jutsio,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jutsio/recent_issues/,5,1605504045.0,"My partner and i have been together for a couple years now. We have been living together for the last half a year because of covid in their apartment (still have my own place that i havnt been going to because of roommates who are high risk of contracting covid) and we have been planning on moving in for almost a year now. We recently got into our first big fight when they expressed that they no longer want to move in together because of my drinking. 

Throughout our relationship i have been truthful, honest, and followed through on every commitment i have ever given them. I quit smoking at the beginning of our relationship and whenever i did something i was not proud of (like having a periodic smoke...i can count on less than one hand how many times ive had a smoke since quitting) I would express that it happened and be forward about it. They spoke with me twice about drinking and both were in context of the bar (from my perspective). First time was that we would go out frequently and stay out late and id drink a lot when we were out and the second time was that i would ask them if i could have another one before leaving. After both discussions I made behavioral changes. I stopped going out as much both with and without them and would not drink as much as well as stopped asking them if i have enough time for another so they were not the ""gate keeper"" to fun as well as not consume as much when we went out. 

For context i drink on average about 5 or 6 light 4.2 abv beers a night at home. Give or take 2 in either direction. I drink them over the course of 7 to 8 hours. I enjoy the taste (yea i know light beer really). I never drink even a sip of alcohol when i have to drive, I do not drink before 5 PM (with the exception of the 4th of july which is an all day BBQ with a lot of guests), i avoid drinking to the point of getting drunk, I dont drink if I have to take meds (such as antibiotics), i did not drink when i had to quarentine for COVID for 2 weeks, i dont drink to cope with stress in fact i stop drinking so i can fix my problems, and if i get full or dont want to continue to drink i will dump a beer even if i just opened it. It has never interfeared or been a problem in my life with my professional or work life until recently with my partner having concerns. 

Back to my issue at hand. My partner has an issue but has no feedback on what i can do to alleviate and move our relationship forward. I have not had a drink since (about 9 days now which is fine. I want to work things out before i drink again) but thats the only thing i can think of to do. I do not argue that i consume a lot of alcohol and that I can drink less but i do not know what else i can do. They do not know themselves. They expressed its concerning for health reasons and I agree that I can drink less. I just dont know what to do beyond not drinking at all because i feel that if i drink around them they will have an issue now regardless of the amount. Not to mention my trust is a little broken from the perspective that they would break away from our future rather than try to work through it and discuss it.

I am lost and confused as to what to do.",2020-11-16 00:20:45

She gets extremely drunk between 1 and 3 times a week, drunk enough to throw up multiple times and often not remember anything from the night before. 

I'm worried about a) her health obviously, as well as b) her social life because she texts and posts a lot when she's drunk and has on multiple occasions sent things out that she regrets, and c) her grades because if her friends are drinking the night before big due dates, she'll join in and then write her papers drunk, and d) I know another kid who was just sent home to do online classes for the rest of the year because he was caught drinking underage at a large party (both because of the party and the drinking) last week, and I don't want that to happen to Jill. 

I might be overreacting though, because I know college is for exploration and all that. I also recognize that I'm overly cautious when it comes to anything related to alcohol because of some childhood trauma, and if I am overreacting I don't want Jill to feel like I'm overstepping or trying to control her life if I bring it up.

Is this actually something to worry about? And if it isn't yet, is there anything I can do to make sure it doesn't get worse? How should I bring it up to her? She'll be coming home for a long break next week and I'll be able to hang out with her in person then, so maybe talking in person could be better?

oh also: she still is very responsible so is of course not going out to parties or anything, she just drinks with her bubble of 8ish floormates.",2020-11-16 06:54:52
Do I have a problem?,1,jsrd8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jsrd8u/do_i_have_a_problem/,8,1605199764.0,"Do I have a problem?

Hello! 
I am hoping for honest and unbiased advice, I’m sorry this is going to be all over the place. 
I graduated college about a year and a half ago and after that I had an out of state job and everything was fine and dandy.. after covid I moved back home (I live with my grandma for reasons I’m about to tell you since 5th- the end of high school). So anyway just so you have a better idea my grandma is very posh and proper and has literally never gotten drunk in her life, she will have a cocktail etc but has never ever gotten drunk. Now for the good part: her sister died of alcoholism, her ex husband was an alcoholic and my mother is an addict.. hence me living with her. So my grandma is not fond of drinking and I don’t blame her. 
But I drank in college and I admit when I drank I drank to get “drunk” go to parties have fun etc, I am not the type of person to order a drink with dinner because I want it to be an event. I never had any issues in college and I drank when I lived alone out of state as well. So my last job was absolutely dreadful. $14 an hour 16 hours a day 23 days straight in a state I didn’t know anyone, idk if that’s even legal! Anyway! I admit I drank more than I used to but again wasn’t really an issue. So fast forward at the end of my job year I had a traumatic death in the family involving someone who I had past trauma with that I never really figured out.. so I move home, I don’t cope and I am not allowed to drink more than a glass of wine because there’s no need says my grandma, mind you none of my friends are around at this point.. this ended up with me just having wine or white claw in my room.. I would tend to binge drink when I did because it had to be so secretive and isolated. I have gotten caught by my grandma three times and she and my mom (now recovered) has threatened to send me to rehab etc. here’s the deal though.. when I drink and get “caught” it’s not like it’s because I’m drunk or anything it’s always because I’m too talkative, sharing things about my trauma, or in a good mood.. which is pretty rare because I tend to keep to myself. I’ve never thrown up, been out of control, blacked out etc. i have been hearing non stop how this is an issue but i feel like this is all based off of my families past and their own demons. I will admit though that when I did drink I kept focusing on the trauma and death and I realize that’s an issue so I have began to see a counselor to assist with that. Idk. Do I have a problem?",2020-11-12 11:49:24
My husband needs help and when I try to talk to him he just gets defensive,3,ju372w,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ju372w/my_husband_needs_help_and_when_i_try_to_talk_to/,4,1605394852.0,"Backstory: (I feel this is important) we met 3 years ago when we were both in our mid twenties. We were both partying And just having fun. We got engaged after 2 years and found out I was pregnant the month after so we got married. Throughout my pregnancy my husband drank, which is when I realized it was an issue. He would get so drunk he’d pass out on the couch while cooking or start drinking on weekends first thing when he woke up because “it’s the weekend”. He drinks every single day. Our daughter is now 7 MO and my husband still drinks daily. I find mini bottles in his work clothes when I do laundry and I know he sneak drinks liquor on his way home so I won’t see it. He has told me numerous times his drinking is “okay because he doesn’t abuse me” but he doesn’t understand he is obviously not the same person drinking. He is stubborn and forgetful and rude. When our daughter was 3 MO he was bathing her drunk and she slipped into the tub face first and that was what I thought was his wake up call. He was so scared and stop drinking for a month. Then 30 days went by and he’d socially drink, which turned into full blown drinking again. we started couples counseling yesterday bc of my post partum and we argue a lot now about the baby. This morning the baby woke at 7 am and I caught him in the kitchen with a bottle of Bacardi about to take a shot when I was going to get her milk. I didn’t yell or scream but I told him that that is not acceptable and we need to talk about it, he got so defensive and said I’m rude and left. 

More background: his father was a a RAGING alcoholic, physically abusive and verbally. He stopped drinking and became totally sober through AA much later in his life. So it is hereditary. 

I’m just not sure what to do, if I confront him he gets so defensive and leaves and will not talk about it, I know it’s the guilt and he knows it’s wrong but how do I approach it?",2020-11-14 18:00:52

HELP! need opinions on my alcohol usage,2,jr5c9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jr5c9y/help_need_opinions_on_my_alcohol_usage/,6,1604981735.0,"Hello All,
This will be my first Reddit post ever, so here we go. 

I guess why i am posting is to tell a little bit of my story (skipping boring details) and hope to get a little bit of advice or maybe just some guidance on what to do in my situation. 

To begin, i am currently a 20y/o female. I had an alcoholic mother growing up. I didn’t begin drinking until about 16 or 17, and it was never an issue. The only issue i had was sometimes i would get a little too drunk, and be messy. 
about a year and 8 months ago i moved to another city, and began going out a lot and drinking pretty much every night. It was situational but i don’t think it would help anyone if i explained. So i began drinking pretty heavily and sometimes would have situations, including fights, yelling, and making a fool of myself in general when i got too drunk. 

something else i would really like to let you know is i take a daily medication for anxiety, Lexapro. I have been taking it for probably 4 years now and have been doing all of this drinking while taking daily lexapro. I obviously know that this is a bad thing and it makes my tolerance and drinking experience different from someone who doesn’t take medication. 

Fast forward to now, i have a friend group who drinks pretty actively, we drink sometimes every day. I tend to blackout a lot, which is (in my opinion) due to my medication, and when i begin drinking, i never stop. i will always search for more and just keep drinking and drinking and drinking.  Obviously this is a problem. 

It has become more of a problem for me over quarantine lately and these past few months have been pretty rough for me. I have had several bad blackouts where i have caused really bad problems with my friends that have brought them to the point where they told me i need to get my shit together or we cannot be friends anymore, because sometimes i can get pretty mean when i’m blacked out. 

It’s strange for me because i am a very kind person, with a huge heart and love my friends very very much. But once that alcohol gets too far into my system, it’s almost like i become another person. It’s so sad to watch myself self destructing my friendships and hurting them so often. 

Lately it has been better, i am still drinking almost as much but i haven’t been causing any issues with anyone, only myself. I will admit to you all that there were a couple of days last week where my roommates were away and i drank white claws all day and just sat around drunk, and then would drink with my friends in the evening. This resulted in me binge drinking for about 3 days and then having really really terrible comedowns, i was so fucking anxious and sweaty and shakey. I was also waking up in the morning (well, mid day) and beginning to drink so that i wouldn’t have to deal with my hangover anxieties that i typically get. 

It’s come to a point basically where i know it’s a problem. I drink so that i don’t have to feel things, as i deal with pretty bad anxiety and depression, and i try to just forget everything constantly. I have gained weight, gained memory loss, lost friends, hurt people, i’m assuming killed my liver, and i think enough is enough. 

I need to quit, but i have such a social friend group who loves to go out and drink. Part of me wants to continue to try to drink in careful moderation, but i want your opinion if you even think that is worth it. I’m assuming it’s not a good idea and i should just quit.

One last thing, i am also so so so so worried about the effects all of this drinking on my medication is having on me. I’m afraid i’ve messed with my brain somehow and i’m just really scared about that. 

If i think of anything else to add, i will edit my post. 

Anyways, if you’ve read this far i appreciate the fuck out of you. I would really appreciate any feedback what so ever. 
Thanks",2020-11-09 23:15:35

I will taste food and whatnot to get that smell on my breath as well.    


Honestly, it's just putting on a show in hopes that your performance is Oscar caliber in tricking those around you that you aren't drunk or drinking.  It doesn't help that they already suspect it and are watching everything you do.  You know and they know.  It's just a matter of time until something goes wrong.  How long can you keep it up?  Something might happen but maybe the night ends and nothing major happened.  You breath a sigh of relief that you skated through but in the back of your mind you wonder...did they suspect something but just didn't say anything?  Sigh...

Complicated situation with my severely alcoholic brother (our mother just passed away). What support do I provide?,1,jsgnl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jsgnl2/complicated_situation_with_my_severely_alcoholic/,2,1605157271.0,"Background:

My brother has been a severe alcoholic for more than 15 years.  About 12 years ago, his wife and kids left him, and since then he's been on-and-off living with my mom or living in a shelter.  He has gone through a CONSTANT cycle of drinking, losing his job, stopping and detoxing, and getting a new job (repeat). My mom has always been his safety net.

Sadly, my mom passed away two weeks ago at 77.  Since then, my brother has been on a horrible bender; he even missed our mom's funeral.  Two days ago he admitted himself to a hospital, and has been detoxing since.

I saw him yesterday, and he told me he wants to go to rehab for 30 days (this would be his 4th stint at rehab).  He seems genuine, but I don't have the money for that, and no one else in the family is willing to pay for it.  In fact, I'm the only person left who hasn't cut off contact with him.

After he is released, he has no money, no home to return to, no one to support him, and the grim reality that our mother is gone.  His phone is currently disconnected and the hotel room he was in is trashed.

I can't pay for his rehab, but I think it's important to help him put his best foot forward for this very last chance, now that our mother is gone.  I was thinking of lending him $5000, which I'm aware I may never see again.  I was also going to allow him into our mother's house, supervised, to pack a bag (I washed all his laundry and put his things in boxes that will go into a storage unit).  After that, I don't know...

In six months, he will get a large inheritance of about $300,000 -- but until then (for legal reasons), not a penny.  We were *hoping* we could legally put that in a trust to only give to him if certain conditions are met, but the way the will was written, that's not possible.  He gets that money, and he may very well drink himself to death with it.

Any ideas or advice?  I leave Saturday to return to Japan, where I live and work.  After that, he's on his own.

Sorry if this was hard to follow; I'm juggling a million things with my mom's estate on top of this and trying to get home to Japan despite covid.  My brain is scrambled eggs!  Thank you for your help.",2020-11-12 00:01:11
Is it possible to be a situational alcoholic?,2,js0hxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/js0hxq/is_it_possible_to_be_a_situational_alcoholic/,5,1605094441.0,"My apologies if this is offensive I’m just trying to figure myself out. I’ve gone through a lot in my life, from childhood to an extremely abusive relationship for almost 10 years where a lot happened to me. My life is now better than it’s ever been - I met a wonderful man I’ve been with for a year, am in therapy working through the past stuff, and have a great job. 

Now, throughout my 20s and into my early 30s, I drank to EXCESS. I would self medicate with it, drink alone, black out, do hair of the dog, you name it. I have anxiety, but I was even too paralyzed to do what it took to get prescription refills on Xanax because getting to the doctor for the controlled substance fill so frequently was hard with everything going on. However, alcohol had the same effects and was easy to pick up.

Because it became a habit to drink this way, I still sometimes struggle and fall back into old ways even though there’s no reason to self medicate now (I know a lot of people blame quarantine but I don’t think that’s a valid excuse). I’m terrified this means I’m an alcoholic even though it seems I’m getting “better”-I am in no way drinking at the level I was before, but there are still slip ups from time to time, and I become unaware of my limit (I don’t handle my alcohol as well as others around me/cannot handle the volume others drink). 

Has anyone had experience with this? I’m surrounded by people who drink, and do drink excessively often, so it’s hard to gauge. I feel shame and worry about my own habits and very scared that this means I have no control over embarassing myself with drunken behavior.",2020-11-11 06:34:01
Alcoholic mother in law .. how do I get my boyfriend to set necessary boundaries without sounding like I want him to abandon her ?,4,jpryte,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jpryte/alcoholic_mother_in_law_how_do_i_get_my_boyfriend/,5,1604789033.0,"How do I explain to my boyfriend that he needs to set boundaries with his alcoholic mother without being offensive?

Hey guys,
 
Just looking for some advice about my alcoholic mother in law. So my bf and I have been forever for a little over a year . We love each other a lot and have been through more than we could have ever imagined during this pandemic and so many other events that unraveled over the last few months.

I’ve heard many passive aggressive comments about his mother and her erratic behavior from other family members (they call her “crazy” all the time) but have yet to meet her because of quarantine restrictions and the fact that she is currently living out of state. 

I never liked that they made these comments as I don’t think it’s anyone place to make rude comments about parents who are addicts or have issues in front of their kids. So I never liked that they did this in front of me or him before I even met her ... they’ve also encouraged him to stop all communication with her , as he’s suffered some rough times (picking her up as a child from bars because she was too drunk and never came home , things like this
)  and other things that I don’t know if he’s 100% comfortable yet or just not interested in reliving those moments to tell me 

Flash forward a few months and I began talking to his mother almost every day via text because of some situations in which I needed to contact her . She’s a sweet person but I can tell now why the rest of
The family doesn’t want him to have involvement with her .

She often texts me and I can tell by the content of the messages that she is drunk. My bf will get an abundance of calls back to back followed by sometimes up to 10+ messages about how his father is no longer into her and only wants her for sex (they’re divorced). All sorts of depressing things that I’m sure he’s had to hear and deal with since childhood.

She often gaslights us by sending us texts about how she can’t live anymore etc. and has a lot of debt (almost 50,000 +)

My boyfriend Is about to get some money and I think she’s expecting him to pay it . He wanted to at first but we’ve been thinking and she’s been on the same path for years despite many chances and warnings from my bf about getting help and the fact that the rest of the family is putting pressure On him to not speak to her .

I feel bad ... but with the way she gaslights me and ive only been on direct contact with her for maybe 2 months just makes me sad for my bf. He’s kind and loves her but she keeps putting him in bad situations and only thinking of herself. She often runs back and forth between he and his father, with drama. They use him as a pawn when they fight and often tries to make him look like he’s chosen sides.

I even think she’s purposefully tried to sprain her ankle to get a response out of my bf after she called him a million times to talk about her financial problems and he didn’t respond . 

How do I go about telling him that it’s time to make serious boundaries? 

I don’t want to be circling the same drain forever or dealing with drama forever . She now wants to move with us and says she misses us though she’s never met me . I don’t want someone coming in and putting more on my shoulders than I can already take. 

Am I being selfish towards my mother in law ??",2020-11-07 17:43:53

It's done further damage to my already damaged marriage.     I think my marriage is done now.

But I stopped drinking on Sunday and feel great.    First three days of sobriety in 8 months.

Just wanted to vent,3,jlxkbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jlxkbd/just_wanted_to_vent/,2,1604238823.0,"I've been on and off problem drinking for something like nine years (I am turning 31 in a week). It's worse at times and better at times. I've been in my better period in 2020 for drinking. Done AA, therapy, medications, HSM, the whole lot. I've suffered from diagnosed low grade depression, anxiety and avoidant personality disorder for that same nine year period, currently untreated in terms of therapy or medications, but for which I've had tried treatments in the past.

Anyway so last week I had a mental breakdown. I have mental breakdowns every few months. I think what triggered it this time was taking a week off from running. Running is my substitute addiction for drinking, but I had physical and mental burnout after running 800 km (or 497 miles in freedom units) in eight weeks. This has happened before, after I completed my first marathon and fell into a suicidal depression. Exercise is known to amplify mental health problems when it's done at a higher intensity and level. 

Without exercise to counter my depression I fell into suicidality again. And so I started drinking heavily, and binged two bottles of gin and a whole bunch of wine and beer over the course of four days, plus benzos. Texted my mum angrily with my antinatalist beliefs saying I wish she had never brought me into existence etc. Took a day off work to drink in the morning. 

Anyway that binge leveled my head out a bit and I'm back to normal. Normal being drink a couple of times a week, mostly on the weekends. I did go to one SMART Zoom meeting which probably didn't help but to a very mild extent. 

You might say that alcohol caused me to be depressed and anxious, but that's not true. I have always felt like this throughout high school, even though I wasn't drinking at all. I was an invisible loner, and really I'm still a loner to this day. I struggle with loneliness a lot, and alcohol helps with that. The reason I can't stop is because of these feelings of being alone. No matter how much I try. I've organised Reddit meet ups in the past (even as recently as organising one last week) and tried to get out there socially, but none of this has resulted in me clicking with anyone. Even when I do click with people (from work or whatever) I find it hard to get close to them. And there's an inevitable drift apart. 

I also don't see the point of being sober when the world is going to shit. We're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction, runaway climate change is happening as we speak. Bushfires and drought is bad now and will only get worse as time goes on. There's an economic depression which will only get worse with ecological collapse. The terrible thing is that either people are ignorant of this reality, or they don't care, or are willfully blind, or like to believe technology will save us (a form of wilful blindness).

Politics has never been worse in terms of intergenerational equality, continuing decisions to not act on climate change and trash the environment (eg they approved the destruction of koala habitat to expand a local quarry). Political decisions ensure the rich get richer, while my partner hasn't been able to find a job despite having a PhD. He's thinking that going back to school to get a degree in education and becoming a high school teacher may be the only way out for him. My sister's partner had to go that route, because there's no jobs in science in Australia. 

I have been involved in climate activism but found it's not for me, I don't fit in with these groups. Plus any activism they could do this year has been fettered by COVID-19 health orders. So they've basically given up this year, which is sad. Not that it matters because activism hasn't changed anything and it never will. The powers that be are just too powerful, and the problems too complex and interconnected.

I honestly do wish I had never been born into this burning planet full of suffering and misery, though I know it's pointless to cry over spilt milk. I just wish I had more close real life friends to commiserate with, as that might take the edge of facing the doom. Because I have these sorts of feelings, I just don't fit into mainstream groups like AA and such, who tend to be happily ignorant of such things or don't want to think about it. 

I guess I'm not ready yet to give up the alcohol, although one day I may come to that point. The best I can strive for is to hopefully come to a place of moderation, or very rare binges once in a while. It's been worse in the past, in that alcohol was the only thing I could think of and craved, so I guess I'm not in the worst place right now. I have plenty of scope to change.

Thanks for letting me vent.",2020-11-01 08:53:43

I don't see any ill effects, I don't get drunk or anything but... dunno, I'm drinking most days and alone... isn't that a sign of a problem?

So im 22 years old and have a slew of mental health issues. I used to use weed to self medicate however I was diagnosed with cannabinoid hypermeisis syndrome in 2018 and despite getting my diagnosis, I started to use weed in intervals until I started to feel sick again.

In may of this year I got incredibly sick and stopped smoking all together.

I started to drink instead as a replacement and Im starting to get worried about my usage and I guess that this is my first step in asking for help/opinions on it.

My therapist knows I drink, yet im also smoking cigarettes a ton more as well. 

I guess I just want other peoples opinion on things.

Please feel free to ask me questions in the comments as I feel Im very open about things and dont mind questions.

If you read my post, thank you, and I hope your day is going well.

Edit: CHS makes you vomit to the point that you cant keep anything down. This may, when it flared, I was unable to keep water down for about 3 days but due to COVID i was terrified of going to the ER to get fluids. 

In addition, I havent told my therapist that my vapes contain nicotine. Ive been chosing to vape rather than smoke cigarettes as I still live with my parents and I want to avoid that jugement plus being able to smoke inside the home vs having to go outside. Thank you.",2020-11-09 22:48:38

I've always been able to stop for a few months before going back to drinking everyday, it's just that I'm scared one day I won't be able to. I'm scared that things will start to get really bad again.

Should I quit for good? Should I make and follow some rules? Is it possible to find a balance after being in a dark place with alcohol as your guide? The fancy booze is quite expensive tho...

I do have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I'm definitely going to approach this... But honestly? Reddit has been giving me some advices that are making my life so much better that I feel I need to ask this too.

Fr tho is way easier to ask people that dealt with it worse than me than it is to ask friends and family. The ones that hear my name and alcohol in the same sentence and think it's a problem again...",2020-11-09 01:55:12

I basically drink every Friday/Saturday to a point of drunkenness or until I can at least feel the effects. I can’t even say that this is social drinking because it’s usually with my partner at home who is very good at pacing herself and can make one drink last the whole night. 

This last weekend we had no alcohol at home and are trying to save our money and I noticed I really missed the drinking, to the point where I finished off the vodka in the cupboard that I would never have normally done... 

Should I be worried? I know this might not sound like the classic signs of someone drinking every day and in secret but I felt really surprised and disappointed in myself.",2020-11-09 23:42:57
"Lockdown has trapped me in my home with this. All I have is making sculpture while intoxicated, and it's killing me.",5,jqcnk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jqcnk8/lockdown_has_trapped_me_in_my_home_with_this_all/,1,1604874777.0,"Sculpture is the only thing that's given me any hope. I was making stuff while blitzed in 2017 and over a period of three months found a way to pour my heart out into my work. I'm an anxious uptight person, I find it hard to express myself freely so this was a revelation. By the end of those months I had found some good in me, finally (it came out in the form of a cute bunny rabbit after years of making ugly demons), my depression and self hatred lifted and I quit drinking and smoking completely, without missing it. I was on a mission to become my best self. The sculpting process also overturned my internalised homophobia and let me come out to myself, and then family and friends. 

I wanted to be pretty, which, as a guy, took a lot to accept. Most of you know how a man in a dress is viewed by most of society. But it's me and my life, so I grew my hair long, bought dresses and got heavily tattooed over all the ugly old self harm. I put *everything* into designing my tats, thousands of hours over 2018 in every spare moment. Art had healed me so I was trusting it to show me the way. The first tattoo session went bad. The artist is brilliant but did something very different to what I expected. Ok. I can adjust. Then I found he'd gone really hard on my skin and in the most detailed bits pieces of flesh started falling off leaving scar tissue and no ink. I was devastated after putting so much into it. After a year sober I started drinking again.

I persevered with the artist (no-one else would touch it) and in time he gave me a sleeve that's prettier than I could have dreamed. All the old scars are covered and I'm now a rainbow of colours :) I was just about to get out and start exploring the lgbt+ scene as my prettiest self when covid arrived and shut me in the closet again. So I'm still stuck in this limbo, making art because nothing else makes sense to me. But I'm getting worse. The process works, I can express myself without fear sometimes, but my alcohol and weed fueled binges are getting worse. When it starts to go ""well"" I get locked in and stay up for days drinking and smoking. That happened once in 2017 but it's happened several times in the last month. I wake up with sores on my face from accidents I barely remember. Fell down the stairs backwards while carrying a heavy model and cracked my elbow. Model was fine. After one binge the skin on the right side of my tummy went numb for a few months.

Until I can go out and dance in a dress and meet people who accept me for who I am I don't know how to break out of this. I'm planning to stop as soon as the weed runs out but I've said that to myself countless times before. I just get restless and anxious and then depressed and hopeless and all the time I *know* that there's this thing that will make it go away. So I end up back here. I just wanted to be free and I'd finally found a way to be a version of myself I could love. I'll be 40 next year so I feel like time is against me. If I start receding before getting to explore this side of me it will take away my hope, pathetic though that might sound. I love all the recent lgbt acceptance but sometimes I get so angry and jealous seeing all the young queer people enjoying life after spending 20 years hating myself for what I am.",2020-11-08 17:32:57

My story,2,jq4n19,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jq4n19/my_story/,0,1604834887.0,"So i quit drinking cold turkey about a month ago. In some ways, its been great for me but in others...well theres been times this month that i have really struggled with not drinking and i think about it often. Its not that i even enjoyed it...it became a coping mechanism of sorts. As far my story goes, well, looking back now I should have seen signs that i was going to have problems. Its almost like drinking problems run in my family. My mom and several of her brothers (so my uncles on my moms side) were all alcoholics at one point and a couple still are. When i first started drinking, it was casual and very tame. Only a couple drinks now and then and mostly just beer. But as time when on, i discovered that i liked having more than a few, getting half drunk and sleepy. There were times where i knew i shouldnt have driven but i did. The other thing is, i started using alcohol in social situations too because i have always struggled with that stuff. Even just one drink would get me lose enough to ""have a personality"". I had always gotten just half drunk, or tipsy, but as my depression worsened and started to get tangled up with drinking, not only did i start turning more towards hard stuff but i also started looking for opportunities to get drunk. Theres one evening in particular that im very ashamed of...getting blackout drunk at a camping trip with many of my friends and my wifes parents. I was very very depressed and i turned to the booze...couldnt help it and i even remember the last drink i had before i couldnt remember anything else. I know my wife had to help me and sober me up a bit, and she was very upset with me too understandably, but i dont remember it happening. But i do know i ruined the trip for her at least because instead of having a good time she had to nurse a drunk instead. I have no idea what i said to any of my friends or if i did anything stupid. Another one was a camping trip with my family and i literally drank all day...from the time i got up to the time i went to bed. I wasnt blacked out that time but i was drunk all day and i was called out on it by one of my cousins in front of a few people. So after a few instances like this, my wife and i agreed that i would just have 1 drink if i had any. But this was still obviously too much. When it came to beer, i couldnt have just one. Sometimes i fought with my wife because of this and any chance i saw to have a couple or a few, i would go for it without a seconds hesitation. I wouldnt even be that drunk most times...i just needed to take the edge off of my depression and anxiety and one wasnt enough. One drink would make it worse. Other times i would have one drink, but it was daily. Then i became a dad which was a year and a half ago. Our son was unplanned but he is loved like crazy. Becoming a dad woke me the hell up and gave me perspective. I always wanted to be a dad...it was a part of the man i desperately wanted to be. I knew in the back of my mind that my drinking habits had to change. So my wife and i decided i would only have hard stuff and again only one drink. I could nurse a whiskey for quite a while so it didnt seem like it would be too hard. With the financial change too, i wouldnt be able to buy booze regularly anyways. Through my sons year and a half of life, our family has had to undergo a lot of change and stress and difficult situations, mostly due to work slowing down and struggling to find much else. We wound up having to move in with family and then eventually we got re-settled again. During that time i didnt really buy alcohol for myself obviously but anytime i could have some...you guessed it...i couldnt have just one. Fortunately i wasnt put in the position where i could drink as much as i wanted to...but i thought about drinking all the time. My depression, certain songs, stress or if my wife and i argued about something all triggered the desire. After getting re-established in our life, i started making better money than ever. Some clients would offer us drinks after the job was done and i easily obliged. At this point and for quite a while honestly, i hated the guy i became once i had even one drink in me. I couldnt stand him. For a while i knew it was coping mechanism to my issues and the things i have gone through in my life, i just dont know when or how it changed from something i enjoyed casually to being something i didnt even like doing. I was doing it to battle my inner demons...i didnt even like the taste anymore. I remember the last bottle of bourbon i had and the last two beers. The last bottle was a few months ago and with it and the bottle before i noticed a new habit forming. I would wait for my wife to take our boy to bed and then i would have a drink...but it wasnt just a one ounce with a mixer...it was more like filling up my whiskey glass with the stuff. Enough to get me feeling it pretty good...in other words i was hiding it from my wife and drinking more than what we had agreed on...again. And if i did pour one before she went to bed, i would put in ice to help hide how much i was having and position myself so she couldnt see how much i poured. I hated every drop of the last bottle and at the end of it i knew i had to stop...but i hadnt told anyone yet...so as soon as my friend offered me a beer, and then another one after that i caved and had them. I hated them too and really hated myself. I knew i had a problem and it was getting worse. I quit cold turkey just days after that, told my wife about it all and prayed for help. My wife has been extremely supportive ever since and for that i am truly grateful. Again, i wasnt getting super drunk all the time, but i was getting to the point of feeling it pretty good. I could barely stick to just one drink and more often would find a way to have more. But the most damaging part is that it was becoming more and more of a crutch. To cope with anxiety and depression and such. This isnt to sound arrogant, but i know im a good guy and a good dad/husband. I just had a certain problem that was getting worse. I never hurt my wife or child. Even my depression...i know its managable outside of alcohol but i allowed myself to turn to the booze. In the past month i have really been able to get back to my previous means of battling my inner demons...playing guitar and lifting weights primarily. I have thought a lot about alcohol but i have made a promise with myself, my family and with god to never drink again.

I still can't socialize, being sober just makes me feel more self aware and anxious. I've gained a lot of weight after I stopped drinking and have no drive to improve myself.

Anyway seeing the drinking in that series really made me miss those weekends I had and how carefree I felt. I feel lonely now.

Recovering alcoholic looking for guidance,2,jmerm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jmerm3/recovering_alcoholic_looking_for_guidance/,7,1604310743.0,"Hi everyone this is my first time posting . I remember the first time I got drunk like it was yesterday I was 16 and had 2 or 3 beers . I immediately thought wow this is the answer I was looking for . At that point I had taken so many different medications to help me focus in school or feel less anxious . Alcohol fixed those things for me in a matter of 30 minutes and it only took drinking a liquid . I began to drink more and more whenever I could for the next  5 years with a small break of 3 months somewhere in-between. When I was 17 I got very drunk one day drank a 26er of whiskey and blacked out . I woke up in a hospital . Apparently I was found at a church and could of died of hypothermia . That should of been my wake up call I feel but it wasn't enough to make me realise I couldn't drink responsibly some how . 

Recently however was my real wake up call . I broke up with my girl friend of three years . Alcohol wasn't necessarily the problem but it was probably a factor along with our distance and covid not helping . I was in so much pain and had finally realised how horrible of a person I had been to so many people in my life because of alcohol and self medicating to treat my mental illness . I decided I was going to have one last bender to go out with a bang . That bender ended with me at a bridge contemplating jumping off . I entered a treatment facility and have been sober for 6 months now . It got to the point where I was making home made grape juice wine in my closet and drinking bottles of it so I could afford some cheap form of liquor . There would be mornings when my roommates would carry me and drop me in the shower because I was so hung over I couldn't move . 

Sobriety has brought me clarity and that's not something I thought I would hate . I can't move on with my life without being held accountable for who I was during those 5 years . I just don't know where to start I feel like I need help . I know that's what AA is for and I've been trying to pursue it but its hard during covid to find a group that I feel I fit with that is in person . I've also been feeling suicidal for months now I feel like alcohol was always the answer for me when I didn't know what to do but now I don't have that answer and it's hard to live without it .

Any idea on how to end a bad habit ?,1,jn0cq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jn0cq3/any_idea_on_how_to_end_a_bad_habit/,0,1604393299.0,"First of all, I would like to apologise for any mistakes, for English is not my first or event second language.
Second of all, I've had a long day and am supposed to wake up in a few hours only...
Third,  lots of brackets.

So to describe my situation briefly, I am a female in my early twenties (nearing the mid though), with a past of drinking alone quite a bit, for quite some time. 

I've got a habit of drinking since I was able to buy alcohol legally on my own. It first happened when I was in college and a love triangle broke out ; a manipulative, gullible girl and a ball-less guy turned me into the home breaker, man stealer antagonist of the stupid story I never even wanted to be part of in the first place. And everyone believed them without even trying to find out or at least hearing me out but one girl. And so I thought I was better off without them (I really was, I don't need this kind of hypocrisy on my life then, now or ever), but I kinda missed the drinking parties so I began to drink alone

And I felt so good.

So really good.

So good that I kept doing it.

My alcohols of choice were soju and vodka.
Soju because I was majoring in Korean.
Vodka because it hits hard and good. And it was (and still is) my favourite party alcohol, easy to forget it's taste when it's mixed with sugary drinks.

I ended up dropping out of college because I no longer had any interest in the classes (too dysfunctional) and I had no ties left.

Fast forward in time. How long ? Who knows ?

So, last summer, I met a guy with whom I had what was to meant to be a one night stand but we kept seeing each other and now we've been together for over one year already and living together for a bit over 6 months. During these few months of living together we've had the greatest pleasure of meeting out neighbour. She's an an old bat who can't stand young people having a night of fun. So she came knocking oh so kindly on our door, during the party, to practically yell at us for being too loud. I do understand that when you have a noisy neighbour that is repeatedly noisy, it gets annoying real fast. But we weren't. In fact, quite the contrary. We already knew she was an old fat lady with a sad life that leaves her trash bag next to the stairs because olfactory discomfort is not important (it actually is where I live and can be punished by law if police can witness it).
How do I know it's her ? Because there's only two door on the stair landing. Here and mine. And it's not me who put the trash there although I really want to.
Anyway, I live in fear she's gonna knock on my door everytime he gets worked up from gaming. And it happens quite often. 

But today was different.

Today he got real angry because his headset didn't work again so he lashed out quite heavily on the different headsets he owned and his desk (that was fixed by wood glue or some thing similar). The thing is he tends to be violent when he gets angry. Not towards me but I am afraid that someday he might turn his anger towards me when he can't lash out on anything else. He doesn't get angry that often but almost since he's a gamer (I am not) bit I get that when thing don't go your way it can be frustrating. But somehow I'm not that scared for my life, since I'm close to his family and thankfully they are rather sane and sensible people that I can trust. And everytime he starts to scream, I get stressed out.

I was able to hold out until today.

Today I picked back up my old bad habit of drinking-crying to sweep it all under the mental rug and and empty the jug until it fills up again and o start to do it again.

So yeah, do you have any idea on how to end that habit without sacrificing the casual drinking with friends on a night out (well not now because covid) or the fine wine during a casual (or not) dinner because French people love their wine and I happen to be born and raised there ?

Also starting a new job and being stopped by my doctor for 3 days last week  because I was coughing might have not helped my case (I got tested for covid and the results were negative so yay I guess?)

So yes, I am stressed out and drinking numbs out the stress out of my emotion jug until it fills up again.
But I don't want it to become a habit because I know how easily I can fall into a bottle of whatever is drinkable and will get my negative emotions numb so I can forget it and continue on my merry way.

I am so sorry to have written so much of my life (that I'd actually very boring, hold on, could it be...?). I will stop for now but fell free to ask any questions and I may or may not answer (I it feels too personal I might not answer bit otherwise, I'll try to give a clear and as short as possible answer).

While I only drank during the evenings and never got crazy blacked out, I am very vigilant about my habits because my sister has full blown alcoholism and I've seen first hand how bad it can get. As such, I'm challenging myself to give up alcohol / create a better relationship with it. I want to acknowledge both the positive and negative aspects of it by listing them.
Positives:
Makes me more socially comfortable 
Makes me more willing to eat (something good as an anorexic)
Makes me more open sexually with my boyfriend
Makes me more relaxed / happy

Negatives:
Can enable me to binge eat
Ruins my sleep schedule

Am I an alcoholic if I only struggle when I'm hurting?,1,jn2meb,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jn2meb/am_i_an_alcoholic_if_i_only_struggle_when_im/,5,1604401533.0,"On mobile so sorry for any shit formatting. Also I've never been on this sub before and I'm not sure what is appropriate so if this isn't then please remove it! Also this is going to be kinda long. Some backstory- I'm Mason, 25, and I know alcoholism and addictive personality runs in the family. The past year has been incredibly hard for me, as it has for everyone, and the hits just keep on coming. I started living alone for the first time a little over a year ago and I love it, but the freedom it affords also means there is no one to check me when my coping mechanisms become self-destructive or I make any other questionable decisions. 

I've found myself turning to drinking a lot more often when I'm upset than I used to. I'm not sure if it is because I used to have more people in my support system than I do now and I like distractions, or if the little addiction switch in my brain turned on at age 24 because one day this past year I looked up and suddenly found myself helplessly addicted to sugar and sodas as well, which I know is very different but still something I'm struggling with. I've looked back and realized that the times I've been at my lowest have also coincided with me getting my most drunk, and also that it only happens when I'm alone (when I'm drinking to cope anyway.) Its close to impossible for me to black out, so that happens extremely rarely, and I hardly ever throw up or have a hangover because my family is blessed with genetics that are amazing at handling alcohol and also gives us all addictive personalities and predilections for drinking, so that's obviously a great combo. So I don't really feel any ~repercussions~ when I sit at home and get shitfaced alone to dull my pain, and I think that is part of the problem. 

But mainly my question regards this. When I am happy, with my friends, having fun, I never feel like my drinking is unhealthy. I am doing it because I'm having fun and enjoying it, not because I feel the need to or because I'm trying to use it to cope. It makes me fun, and makes it easier for me to interact with people at the parties I go to where I don't know anyone. Drunk Mason can make friends with anyone, and is the life of the party, and doesn't puke, and sings and dances and jokes and makes friends and wakes up early without a hangover and makes a bomb ass breakfast. And I genuinely love that Mason. It's one of my favorite versions of me. Thinking about going to parties and nursing a juice or something makes me so sad. This is the time when it's easy for me to party, and it doesn't make me feel like shit physically like I know I will when I'm older, and it's my favorite way to meet new people and make new friends, which is something I haven't always been good at. I really don't want to give up drinking because of that.

But, and this is something I haven't said out loud before, my drinking habits when I'm alone and upset scare me. My mom quit cold turkey when she found out I was pregnant with me, hasn't had a drink in over 25 years, and won't let me bring jack Daniel's in the house because it still triggers her addiction in a way she doesn't feel strong enough to fight. My grandma ""doesn't have a problem"" but drinks a bottle of wine while she makes dinner every day and opens a new one to have with the meal. I watched my dad break all the bones in his fingers on a tree when I was a kid because he was drunk and got mad that I forgot to put the lid back on the peanut butter. I don't ever want to be like that. And just tonight, on the eve of the election while I'm struggling to not slip into a panic attack, I sat on the floor nearly tearing my hair out staring at a bottle of whiskey and crying and telling myself not to, when 2 days ago on Halloween knocking back a 12 pack made me the life of the party and I made so many new friends. I've always been able to talk to my parents about anything but I don't feel like I can go to them about this because it makes my mom so sad to think about me struggling in the same way as her and my dad, and she is already so worried about me when I drink I think it would break her heart to find out she actually had reason to worry. 

I guess I'm not entirely sure what my question is. Alcoholic is a really scary word to me because of my family. I'm not sure I'd be able to admit it, or say it out loud. But as I sat here on the verge of a panic attack and all of a sudden heard myself speaking out loud, telling myself over and over again not to open that bottle, that I was strong enough to get through this sober,  I know that I have a problem. I just don't understand how the Mason who is the life of the party and the absolute man when I happy drink can possibly turn around and send myself into a dark hazy stupor to numb the pain 2 days later. And I don't know how to combat that problem because I genuinely love the social drinking. I guess I just need advice on what to do about it, and if my alone time drinking is a bad enough, unhealthy enough thing to take away my happy fun time party drinking. Or maybe I just need someone to read this and understand, or tell me nice encouraging words. Thank you so much for reading, if you're still here after that completely novel I just composed.

This is a throwaway account made in hopes of helping someone else who may be in a similar situation before it's too late. If there's content in here that triggers or offends anyone then I'm terribly sorry. Just trying to help as someone who's hit rock bottom. I'm a 21 year old male in college in the US. I graduate in December. I'm also a pilot who teaches people how to fly for a living. I've shortened this story to only hit the key points of my relationship with alcohol. My relationship with alcohol started when I was just a teenager. My dad worked on Wall Street and lost his job in 2013. He then started drinking a ton every day and abusing my mom, my twin brother, and me. I was always afraid of alcohol and refused to ever become like him. I've heard this countless times in my support groups. I started drinking when I was 18. Never in excess, never by myself. I drank in college with friends. Sophomore year I drank too much. Went to the hospital and was tagged with a .202 BAC. Last year after the virus hit I started drinking alone, and drinking a lot. I started drinking not just because the virus was ruining my industry and making it impossible to find a job, I also experienced a very traumatic event. My neighbor was a college dropout. He moved to our college town to make friends. He showed up at my door and introduced himself as my uber driver from the other night (he actually was, small world lol). It started off as drinking on weekends. I was never around him sober and when I drank at that point I always got pretty drunk. As the ""friendship"" progressed I realized he was suffering from a variety of mental health issues. It got to the point where he put it all on me and relied on me hanging out with him to keep him on this earth. He told me every time. I was stuck in such a bad situation with him, but I told myself that it was going to be ok. He ended up trying to take his life one night. If it wasn't for me checking up on him because I got a bad feeling, I don't know if he'd still be here and would have gotten the help he truly needed. That event was the breaking point and it sent me downhill. It wasn't uncommon for me to put down a handle in 2-3 days. That went on for about 3 months. My relationships suffered, my schoolwork suffered, and I was drinking in the morning to cure my hangover. I was having an absolute blast being drunk 24/7 in my own fantasy world. Little did I know what I was doing to myself and my body. My ex said I pulled a knife on her when I was blacked out. Drunk me scared sober me so much. When it came time to drive back home from school in March I put the bottle down. The withdrawals hit me like a freight train. I would never wish those withdrawals on my worst enemy. The voices in my head and sights I saw were absolutely hell on earth. I will never forget the look on my mom's face when I first walked in the door shaking and easily distracted. It broke my heart to see her like that. If you ever get to this point: please realize this is a medical issue and don't try to detox by yourself. I detoxed by myself at home and it was awful and dangerous. I'm a flight instructor. I teach people how to fly for a living. I was pretty damn good at it too. To this day I have NEVER mixed alcohol and work for fear of losing my career. I lost it anyway. Over the summer I recovered, gained weight and stopped drinking except for a few weekends. I thought I was healed, how stupid was I. I got back to college and didn't drink for two weeks. Then I went right back to my old ways. I got COVID in early September. After I got better I started drinking heavily again. The nail in the coffin was in the beginning of this month. I strung together a 7 day bender filled with drinking alone and drinking with friends. I missed work, school, and hanging out with friends while sober. I went to work at 7:30AM one day. I was sober for the first time in 7 days. I went home after and tried to take a nap. I was confronted with the worst pain in my stomach I have ever felt in my life. It was so bad that I ended up having to go to the hospital. I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. My enzymes were at about 30 times where they were supposed to be. If you think you have to drink heavily for years to damage your body just take me for example. That mindset leads to continued drinking and it just gets harder to recover. After I got out of the hospital, I found out that I probably won't fly ever again. The FAA has several hoops for pilots with alcohol on their records to jump through. It takes years and costs money to get your medical certificate back. Well, here I am now. Celebrating one month sober. It's hard to sleep at night, but every day I wake up refreshed and full of energy. My grades in school have never been better. What I would give to go back in time to the beginning of college. I'd do anything. So for anyone who's my age or younger or older, please take my story seriously. You're stronger than alcohol, but please get help before it's too late. I didn't.",2020-11-01 02:43:15
Need advice,6,jlnpyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jlnpyi/need_advice/,5,1604198657.0,"Hi, I'm 31, 5'4"" Male, and about 120 pounds, for the past year or two, I've been drinking every weekend (Friday and Saturday) heavily. Whiskey with 2 to 3 cokes. Starting around April, I noticed that I would have a little trouble breathing. At first I thought it was covid and got tested. Results came back negative. 

The breathing issue comes and goes at random times throughout the week, sometimes it's not bad and sometimes it is bad. Othertimes there's no issue at all. I've had bloodwork done and nothing was found to be wrong with my liver or anything else.  


Could my random bouts of shortness of breath be related to alcohol? I'm getting upset because my doctors can't find anything wrong. Nothing was wrong with my lungs,  I've tried inhalers to no effect. It's all very frustrating.

I made a huge social mess and lost my dignity yet again. I’m ready to stop now. Some people can drink and some should refrain. The latter is me. It’s time to find peace in myself.,2020-10-31 10:39:30
Trying to get things right. I want to still be able to have beers. Just not every single night.,12,jibbn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jibbn0/trying_to_get_things_right_i_want_to_still_be/,17,1603732302.0,"So the title says it all. I don’t want to continue to drink daily. Here’s a little background. 

Up until 2 years ago when I got out of the business I worked in the craft beer industry for roughly 15 years. So this meant two beers after work minimum and more than likely many more after that. It’s what they do. Since it was such a big part of my life it just sept into all other parts of my daily routine. Plus I love the taste of all the difference styles of beer! Mowed the yard, need to pound a beer. Can’t sleep, have a few more beers. 

So here we are during a pandemic and 6 and a half months ago I quit smoking cold turkey. It wasn’t fun but I did it. Ever since then I’ve just noticed the addiction with beer(alcohol)seems more clearly evident. Like I’ll have 3 and then next thing I know I’ve had 8...Like just a few short hours later. I’ll go from ready to go to bed to hammered very quickly. Now that I don’t work in the industry I definitely drink considerably less but that’s not saying much. 

I’m currently not working because I was in the middle of trying to find out what the hell I want to do when the pandemic hit. So drinking 4-8 beers a day when you don’t have a job rarely makes you feel better about yourself. I’m fortunate to have a loving wife, with a stable job that she gets to work from home. She is a light drinker very much so. Just here and there. Comically like I was in my 20’s. Smoked pot but rarely drank because I felt like I gave up control when I became intoxicated from alcohol. Well now I basically don’t get hangovers but I do get terrible “brain fog”. I often don’t recall conversations etc. from the last hour or two before I fall asleep. Sure we’ll call it “failing asleep”. Its scary, depressing and embarrassing amongst other things. Then my OCD spikes because I’m not accountable and welcome to more depression. 

Just this last week I spoke with my doctor about cutting back and what would be a healthy start. The deal was 4 beers a day this week. 3 beers a day next week. Then 2 max beers a day the next week and onward. Well I did good 3 of the nights. 4 of them I well exceeded. Because of COVID I rarely leave the house. But tonight was band practice. This was the start of week 2(no more than 3 beers a day). I had my 3 beers at practice and it went well. Until I get home and feel frisky and have another. Now I was good and stopped and these were spread out over many hours so I’m not even slightly intoxicated. But I fucked up and had an extra. And still can’t sleep! Did I mention my sleeping pattern is horrendous. If I don’t get drunk, I can’t sleep. So if I drink too much I feel like a failure and if I don’t drink I feel like shit because I can’t sleep...

I do love marijuana in numerous forms. I don’t do it all day and don’t usually consume high amounts. It helps with anxiety, my OCD, and I feel like I’m just a more empathetic person. I also am into psychedelics. Also, low doses. My wife has zero issue with these things. My therapist has zero issues with these things minus the psychedelics. She clearly warned me of risks of psychosis etc. Also she made it clear that the science is just too limited to know the truth on that front as of yet. The point of me telling you that back history is this. I feel like those things benefit me and certainly don’t make things worse for me. I never once just go “if only I could smoke another bowl things will be better”. Never happens. I pretty much just smoke a bowl a day (in the evening) and eat a 15 mg edible after dinner and I’m cool. But it does that with alcohol. I don’t say those words out loud but I’m pretty sure I hear my internal dialogue suggesting things like that. Alcohol is very suggestive. 

So if I have these crutches/tools/substances that I like, seem to help me and are supported by the people around me...why do I choose alcohol? The one that doesn’t check those boxes. Addiction is the answer. That’s why. I started noticing the same thing with cigarettes before I quit. Thoughts like, “why am I doing this thing that I don’t enjoy anymore”? Now I’m seeing that here more than ever and asking myself that very question regarding alcohol. 

How do I fall asleep without intoxication? 

How do I 100% commit to me cutting back? 

This is the first time I’ve posted. Thank you for listening. I’m well aware that I know most of these answers to the questions I’m asking, but I’m struggling and could use a little help. Thanks in advance Internet strangers.",2020-10-26 13:11:42

I have a question, and im a bit shy about posting it. So, back in June of 2019 to probably June 2020 I was in an abusive relationship and to cope i would drink my ass off every day. Mainly to subvert my anxiety and depression. And quite a lot too. More than two glasses. While I've left my ex and am now dating someone better, I find myself still craving alcohol and while not getting as drunk as often as I used to, I noticed I cant quite...get rid of it. Like im not drinking to enjoy myself, im drinking to divert my depression and anxiety.

Another thing I should mention, part of me was really worried that something was wrong with me, so I would go to AA meetings with a friend from a local crossfit gym. I told my parents about it and they called me pathetic so I stopped going. I never told them why I was going in the first place. 

Sorry if this is a weird question, I just feel so ashamed lately because im reallt worried ill turn back into that person who was getting shit faced every night.

I have finally admitted I have a problem.,3,jhwp5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jhwp5t/i_have_finally_admitted_i_have_a_problem/,3,1603673799.0,"My entire family has struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. Thankfully I'm nowhere near as bad as either of my parents were at my age but that's no excuse. 

&#x200B;

I've always gone a little too hard on drinking nights with friends. I've only thrown up 3-4 times, and I've only blacked out once. But I can pretty much drink anyone under the table. I thought since I've *only* blacked out once, and I've *only* gotten sick 3 or 4 times, I'm fine. There's other people my age who get way more drunk than I do more often!

&#x200B;

Pre-pandemic, I drank maybe once a weeknight (a few drinks, nothing crazy) and then MOST weekends I would get pretty drunk at least one night. I thought this was alright. 

&#x200B;

But now that I've been unemployed, depressed, and gaining weight since March (thanks Covid), my drinking has become a pretty severe problem. I drank almost half a handle of vodka the other night, and I DIDN'T EVEN GET THAT DRUNK. That's how high my tolerance is. Not to mention I'm VERY overweight so I need more alcohol than a lot of people anyway. I've spent so much money on alcohol even though I'm unemployed. I drink a 12 pack of Angry Orchards or White Claws in a matter of a night or 2. I drink a whole bottle in a night or 2 on top of those. 

&#x200B;

I keep telling myself ""Once Corona ends, I won't need to drink so much anymore."" But I had a moment last night, during my 13th drink of the night, that I need to stop. And stop NOW. Because what if Corona ends, and the drinking doesn't stop? Where would it stop?

&#x200B;

My boyfriend keeps telling me I don't have a problem; and I've been using this as an excuse to drink more. But my boyfriend is ignorant in the world of alcohol and drug abuse. He's never known anybody to fall to addiction. I witnessed my parents and other family members go through addiction. I can see how he wouldn't understand it's the beginning of a much worse problem.

Over the last 12 months I've noticed a dramatic creep up in my drinking habits.

It started with treating myself to a glass of whisky every Friday 7pm after work to cap the week off.  Then it became Fridays + one or two days per week after a stressful day of work.  Then it became every day of the week (every day has a bit of stress right?).  Then COVID hit, and i'm now working from home.  7pm became 5pm, then 4pm and now I find myself craving my ""treat"" at 3:30 to wrap up the workday.  Once I start with my first whisky at 3:30, I continue and end up having 6-8 servings every day of the week.

I decided this isn't healthy or sustainable, but I can't seem to get out of the habit of craving my 3:30 drink.

Sister (26) needs advice for dealing with brother (24) suffering from alcoholism,5,jf8bsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jf8bsm/sister_26_needs_advice_for_dealing_with_brother/,8,1603293923.0,"*My apologies for the length of this post but getting this off my chest was surprisingly therapeutic.*

Background: My younger brother (24) has had a drinking problem that most likely started when he was 13 or 14. He has stated in the past that he used to steal alcohol from my parents and drink in the mornings before going to class. Since we went to the same high school, his friends told me that he had a reputation for drinking a lot (and doing drugs). I attempted many times to convince my parents not to let him go to parties/gatherings with certain friends because I knew there would be alcohol and/or drugs. However, my parents never took my concerns seriously and continued to drive him to these gatherings/parties.

In hindsight, my parents were probably in denial until they found weed in his room during the summer after he graduated from high school. They were very upset and when my mom called me about it, I begged them to get him professional help since he graduated at 16 and was still a minor. However, once again, my parents did not listen to me and allowed him to go to college as a minor.

We realized the severity of his drinking issues when he had to be hospitalized at the age of 17 during his first spring break for alcohol poisoning (0.37 BAC). My parents then tried to stage an intervention but it did not work and since his college was thousands of miles away from home, he most likely continued to drink excessively throughout undergrad.

To make matters even worse, at the age of 19, he was diagnosed with severe mental health issues during his first year of medical school. His drinking has gotten progressively worse since his diagnosis. He initially took his medication and saw a psychiatrist regularly, but then he stopped and has refused to take any medications/speak to a mental health professional for the past three years. He eventually got kicked out of medical school two years later (long story) and lived with me in my small apartment for almost a year because he did not want to live with my parents.

It was absolute hell living with him because he was drunk every single day since there is a liquor store across the street from my apartment. He damaged my stuff while drunk, ate everything in my fridge, and trashed my apartment. He also never applied for a single job that entire year. Whenever I got upset about his behavior, he became verbally and emotionally abusive to me so eventually I had to kick him out. Moreover, since he refused to take any medications, about 20% of the time he was delusional, extremely paranoid, and depressed or manic. After he moved out, my parents paid for all his living expenses, paid off his sizable student debt (with zero stipulations from him), and he bounced around from Airbnb to Airbnb until the covid lockdowns started.

Currently, my brother, our younger siblings, and I are living at my parents' house and his alcoholism has caused so many issues. Since my parents do not trust him to drive their cars, he is forced to rely on us to drive him everywhere. He is insufferable whenever he goes in the car because even though we tell him not to buy alcohol, he sprints into every store, buys liquor or a twelve pack (using stimulus funds), and then immediately runs back to the car to start drinking it.

We are in a tough spot because my parents' house is in an extremely rural area and there is no public transportation or Uber/Lyft service. If we tell my parents that he is buying alcohol whenever we go out so they stop letting him go with us, they will probably take out their anger on us because they avoid talking to my brother at all costs and the easier solution is to not let anyone go anywhere using their cars. My parents are homebodies and do not like us going anywhere in general due to covid so they will happily use this as an excuse.

During our last outing, when we refused to stop at a gas station so he could buy alcohol, my brother lashed out at me and said the most vile, despicable things that a brother could ever say to a sister. After his emotionally abusive attacks, I refuse to go in the car with him now and we are not on speaking terms. Unfortunately, he manipulates our younger siblings into driving him places and although they are sick of his behavior, they do not want to fight with him. They also do not want to tell our parents that he is buying alcohol out of fear of being trapped at home for weeks and not being able to drive the cars for necessities.

What do you recommend that I do during this situation? Is it pointless to try and convince my siblings to stay firm and not drive him anywhere? Should we tell my parents even if it's pretty certain that they will not allow us to use their cars as retaliation? Should I just give up on trying to stop enabling his alcohol abuse because he doesn't want to stop drinking? If we do not drive him anywhere, he will walk for five hours to the nearest store to purchase alcohol anyways and has done that multiple times in the past.

Tl;dr: Due to covid, my siblings and I have moved temporarily back home and my siblings continue to drive my brother places where he can purchase alcohol because they do not want to argue with him. My brother does not want to stop drinking so should I continue to try and stop my family from enabling him or give up until he wants to address it on his own?",2020-10-21 11:25:23

Within the last 5 to 10 years I’ve faced a lot of loss in my family, most recently my father. He always told me I was living in his path which when he was alive was a great path to take but now that he’s gone it’s a dark path ahead. To be honest my drinking problem started fairly young.My parents divorced when I was young and I grew up with parents wanting to be a friend more than a source of guidance, so at the age of 9 or 10 I had my first drink, of course my dad said it was taken so I would hate the taste so much I wouldn’t touch it later... 
A regular drinking routine didn’t start til I was 18, felt pretty basic but I had a couple of nights where I had angry friends because I went too far and made of fool of myself and them. As most dumb 21’s go I got a dwi which actually straightened me out enough from 21 to about 30 which was a nice streak, I met my wife,  bought a home, and truly began life in a positive direction. 
After 30 hit I faced a lot of loss in my family starting with my grandma that I truly fed on for her positive attitude in every situation. When she passed I went into a dark place, one that I could still function, Maintain my daily responsibilities then goto the bottle and drink the pain away. My dad had been sick for years and on dialysis and passed a year ago. He had found faith and peace before he passed so I have no doubt his life had meaning but for me the hole just got deeper. My wife and I had flown back home for his funeral and I was so openly hurt that before the plane left the tarmac I needed a drink in my hand. I was
Hiding morning drinks before coming back to the house days before his funeral and would spend time in the rental crying after I finished my bottle. 
Now, a year after my dads passing I finish a handle

Today is the day I’ve realized I really need to quit drinking. I’ve been a severe polyaddict, addicted to meth, Coke, and Xanax. This ended up with me in the psych ward twice this year (for a month each stay) and rehab once (only for a month because I was sexually harassed there). The first time I was able to admit to myself that I’m an alcoholic was the last time i was in the hospital. It’s getting really bad now. I’ve gone to the middle of the forest and swam in a deep river in the pitch black of night and barely remembered it while drunk, I regularly drink by myself, anytime I drink socially or enough to get as drunk as I’d “like” it always ends with me puking for hours. Hangovers have drastically affected my work. I spend loads of money on alcohol and I’m not even at the legal drinking age yet. I’ve mixed alchohol with drugs that could’ve caused deadly reactions easily. I let my friends pierce my ears/cartilage with unsanitized safety pins which lead to an urgent hospital visit and sedation with medical fentanyl use. I’ve experienced some withdrawal symptoms. And as of recently.. the thing that scares me the most... I’ve been drinking so much that I’ll say and do things I would never ever do, and not have any recollection of doing them even immediately afterwards. And I’ll bang my head against walls and have dangerous falls and not care. I’ve been blacking out these days because I’ve had to drink more and more to get drunk, once I start I can’t stop. Today my best friends mom told me I’m not allowed to drink at his place anymore, but that’s all I do with people. I used to tell myself it’s fine that I drink because at least I’m not smoking meth anymore, but now it’s getting as bad as my meth use.. and it’s my worst fear coming true.
I think I should start going to AA again.
I need someone to talk to, I feel so alone. I wish I could just drink like a normal person but I can’t.

I’m turning 19 in 15 days. That could be the death of me, then I’ll have full access to alchohol. I need to stop before that. I have a two six of vodka and a bit of tequila left and I want to flush it but idk how to make myself do that.

Please help.",2020-10-26 08:55:20

In fact, I got a bottle of bourbon as a gift to the host. What do you know, there were many 12 pack of craft beer, three 30 pack watered down national brands, 10 bottles of liquor of different sorts, and plenty of ice. I didn't crave any of it, in fact, I hated the smell of people's breath - beer breath and hard liquor breath have different smell of alcohol, but repugnant if you are sober. Then, there were two guys fights, almost getting into fist fight until some of us guys had to break them up. Then, the emotional dude started getting clingy with his girlfriend and saying how much he's been bad to her.. Then, drunk guy shouting how this is an awesome night and falling down and not getting up. Damn, if I had been drinking with them, maybe and it's a big maybe I'd have had a decent time. But being sober and only drinking water.. these kind of parties or get together are now getting too old and stale for me. Does this mean I am not fun anymore?

My journey. How messed up do you think my liver is? Some tips to keep me healthy?,2,jg183f,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jg183f/my_journey_how_messed_up_do_you_think_my_liver_is/,9,1603407608.0,"This is the first time i'm letting this out. Here we go:

I (20M) have been drinking for a while now. I want to give it up because I don't know who I am anymore and I think my liver is completely smashed by now.
I started drinnking when I was 14. Nothing serious, me and my friends were drinking at least twice a month when we had our nights out. Wouldn't need too much to get completely wasted. Few cans of beer and we were hammered. Through highschool I started drinking more and more. When I finished highschool I was already drinking 2-3 times a week, as often as possible. A few cans of beer weren t enough anymore. 
Then when I was 19 i fled the nest and moved from my parents house(who always told me how bad it was to drink but i kept it hidden from them)
I moved with a guy from work who was drinking everynight. Not that much, just a few glasses of wine but i was forcing it. I've been drinking everynight since then. It's been a year and a half now. I was drinking maybe 5 cans of beer(500ml) and a few glasses of wine everynight. Beer stopped being enough a few months later. 8 beers and it wouldn't be enough.

I was trying to get rid of my anxiety. I knew it was wrong but I was a different man when drinking. Making lots jokes and laughing. Everything seemed more interesting. I was confident. 
My anxiety stopped going away and I wouldn t get drunk anymore. Only kind of dizzy but it wasn t enough.

I started uni. More social pressure, anxiety was even worse. I had to drink something else. So that s when I met vodka. Vodka was a great friend of mine, in the end becoming my worst enemy. 
Was doing 400ml of 40% vodka everynight. I moved to the campus. More more more everynight. Night wasn't enough anymore. Started skipping classes and work to hand out with my friends. I had some money aside so that was great for me. 700ml 40% i drank everyday. I went to work sometimes. Stopped going to uni at all. Was just staying in the dorm rooms with my friends drinking and smoking, and doing pills and MDMA once or twice a week.
Every morning when I woke up I had to drink. I was doing anything possible to achieve my goal. My friends stopped drinking. I drank more and more. I got to 1L of vodka a day. Everyday... I drank between 400 to 1000 ml of vodka everyday for more than 7months. Lost my job, lost uni.

Then boom coronavirus happened. Had to get back home. I was staying at my parents'. I had about 2 weeks clear. I was feeling good but then one night I said what the hell,

""i will have some vodka. It won't be as bad as before"". Started drinking again. 200ml a day for a few days. Then 500 again... Eventually the lockdown was off so I started hanging out with my old friends from my hometown. May, june, july. Drank everynight with them. Every single night. At least 6-8 cans of beer. It was enough.

Moved again. New man. 1-2 cans of beer everynight for a month and a half. Maybe two. Now again for the past month 4 to 10 cans of beer or 500-700 ml of vodka per day. Doing coke, mdma, pills, ketamine once a week, maybe more. 

Two days ago i was broke again. No money. I realised that i spent all of my money on alcohol again. 

For the last year, every sip of alcohol I had reminded me of how i shouldn t do it. It fucked with my brain, made me more anxious and unproductive than ever. I fear for my health, i think i pushed it too far and now it s too late. I had dreams and I wanted to have a future. Alcohol sure helped me to destroy all that. Made me feel like I was living something real when it was all a big illusion. now all I can think of is a death in my youth. I tried to give up alcohol more times than I can  count. I tried for so long. So many attempts and all I could do was a few days in a row. 
I have hidden from my friends and family on so many ocasions. Smuggled alcohol wherever I was going. Mall, friends, parties, any kind of social event. I would just go the toilet and chug the vodka(usually vodka) . I learned to live with it and almost nobody could figure it out. I never let people help me with this problem. I furthered away from them. I betrayed myself, lied to everybody else. I have big debts and regrets now. It just seemed to make it all better. Made me funnier, confident, free. Bullshit. 


Feeling functional pushes me into trying to make things better. I decided once again to stop drinking for all. I'm not dead yet so I'm still telling myself :

""man up little bitch"" 

But the little bitch won't listen some of the times.

This was my journey with alcohol. How messed up do you think my liver/kidneys/heart is? Be honest.

How much did you drink and for how long? 

 Some tips to regenerate my mental and physical health?

High Functioning Alcoholics?,13,jhvbqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jhvbqi/high_functioning_alcoholics/,10,1603669003.0,"I have a pretty serious drinking problem. During college, I would get blackout drunk probably 4 times a week. At the time, I would justify my habit because I was in college and ""everyone gets drunk"". It hit me that it was a problem for me when my grandfather passed and my first instinct was to drink. After that moment, I tried to cutdown. Initially, I didn't drink for 6 months, but after that ""milestone"" I reverted to my old ways pretty quickly.

Since I've graduated, it became more easy to justify my drinking. I'm making great money, I'm doing well at my job, I've gotten into pretty good shape. But whenever I do go for a drink, I end up drinking a lot. I kind of make a bet to myself that I wouldn't drink for 2 weeks in order to justify getting drunk for a weekend.

I think my habit is especially concerning given my family history. My dad and brother both drink quite heavily. My uncle died at 45 from drinking himself to death. They both deny having a habit and usually justify it with their financial success. They're both worth > $10m. I feel myself starting to use the same excuses. I'd say to myself I'm doing great in terms of finances or physical health and so I could justify recklessly drinking, but it. honestly just makes me sad. It is really hard for me to separate my sense of self-worth from my career. I do love being ambitious and goal oriented, but it makes it too easy to deny having a drinking problem. 

 I feel like drinking is a pretty shit deal for me right now. It would be great to be able to socialize with friends/family and just have 1 drink and be content, but I have realized that's not the case for me. It's always that whenever I make plans with friends or go on a date, it needs to involve drinking. 

I think my first step is to just not drink for a month and then track the ways that my life has improved and then focus on improving those aspects the most. I also hope I can get my family to realize they have a problem and that it will kill them if they don't stop. It's just hard to confront this problem when your performance (with respect to common metrics) is increasing.

I dont think I have any questions but it would be great to hear from people that have overcome this.",2020-10-25 19:36:43

going to try quitting booze the same way i quit cigarettes,8,jdn40h,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jdn40h/going_to_try_quitting_booze_the_same_way_i_quit/,2,1603079965.0,"rambling ideas for how i am going to get sober and stay sober for longer than a week or two:

i'm in my mid 20s and i smoked from ages 19-22, quit, and picked up drinking right after. an ex girlfriend who was about 10 years my senior told me when i was 20 that i ""smoked a lot for such a young kid"" .... i think i have a tendency to binge on anything i enjoy doing. i don't need anybody to tell me that i drink a lot now - i know that i do and that it's a problem. i think i use both to distract myself from my OCD and depression - smoking was a ritual i could focus on, and drinking numbs whatever i am anxious about. 

i quit cigarettes by a) romanticizing growing old and telling myself that i will never get beautiful grey hair if i die young from lung cancer, b) chewing gum, and c) convincing myself that cigarettes smell gross. 

now i'm going to try to focus on healing my liver, maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, drinking a lot of seltzer and tea, and turning my nose up at the smell of alcohol. i have a half drank cup of wine i plan on leaving on my bedside table until it molds - just like the soggy ashtray i left on my bedroom window for a month three years ago. and maybe with the money i save from not drinking i will be able to afford a therapist.

i've tried to quit before and it always goes like this: the first two days i feel like shit, then i feel great and energetic for about a week & take on a bunch of new projects and try to regain control over my life by spiraling into an OCD nightmare, then something triggers my anxiety and i relapse to self medicate. this time i'm going to take it slow - just because i'm sober doesn't mean i now have to deep clean the house, take up knitting again, and go on a hike every afternoon. i'm going to allow myself to be moody, watch tv, eat ramen, and work on jigsaw puzzles for hours on end. once the covid nightmare is over maybe i'll go to meetings - i tried in the past but my anxiety wouldn't let me. my boyfriend is on board with this journey of mine though so maybe he would come with me. thanks for reading if you got this far.",2020-10-18 23:59:25

She is my biggest supporter and understands my struggle with drinking.

We had a couple come over and did a socially distant hangout last week. I had three drinks to see how I felt and then I stopped myself. After they left, she asked how I felt, and I told her the craving was very strong and it did not feel good. 

The next day, I realized how much I did not like drinking after 30ish days without it. The craving, the anxiety, the exhaustion from having it cloud my head, the bad memories, all of it. I am glad I had that test situation in a controlled environment to see how it felt.

I have not had a drink since then and it feels really good. I find myself not drinking because I don't want to, as opposed to ""I can't or shouldn't,"" and that feels awesome.

Hope everyone is doing well on their journeys. Hard to believe I was putting down a fifth of whiskey on a worknight consistently or putting down a 12 pack of strong IPAs earlier this year. Progress feels great.",2020-10-24 00:57:39

Back story: We worked together and decided to quarantine together at my house months ago when Covid hit. I used to keep beer in the fridge and a big bottle of Jameson around for weekends or whatnot. He began drinking everything. I asked him not to and to please buy his own drinks if he wanted something. He agreed. Actions were the complete opposite. Flash forward to today. He owes me money but can drink and smoke every day. He has gone so much as to hide my liquor bottles that he’s finished deep in the trash or another rooms trash can. He drank the liquor I asked him not to. I had brandy that I cooked with hidden in the pantry and the bottle is now empty. I have had conversations on conversations trying to let him know if he’s going through something I’m here or that maybe he has a problem with drinking etc. I’m a nurse and the nurse in me is fighting to want to help but I don’t know what more I can do or take. He has a family history of alcoholism too. I’m sorry my thoughts are so scattered. I suppose I could use some tips on how to help him or advice on what to do.

Slight Withdrawls/Tremors after Drinking,2,jf3ep5,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jf3ep5/slight_withdrawlstremors_after_drinking/,21,1603272586.0,"About a month ago I went to the beach for labor day weekend, and pretty much got hammered 3 nights in a row. This then caused the 2nd time in my life I've had withdrawls: Shaking, tremors, hard to sleep, felt like I was going to stop breathing.

It lasted 3-4 days until I finally felt basically normal. I've only ever experienced it once before. This was probably the worst experience of my life. I was convinced it was because I just literally did 3 straights days of just drunk-hungover-drink_to_cure_hangover, repeat.

I'm in my late 20's, I'm a social drinking. Hate drinking alone, never drink during the week. On weekends we got out and I get decently drunk, not really blacked out safe for a few times.

Now the problem is, whenever I drink literally even once, I begin to slightly feel it. Drinking sat night, the sunday night sleep is kinda rough and I 'feel' it Monday. It's nothing super bad, but I can feel it's there. I'm guessing it's because those bad days are still so recent I begin to feel like I could enter them again by drinking. Maybe it's all in my head. I know the withdrawls/tremors are from your body not having the alcohol anymore, but how could I get withdrawls from literally drinking once a week?

I don't want to quit cold turkey, I've never felt like I have a problem. I'd like to be able to have a few beers on the weekend. I'm debating on going all of November without drinking, to try to reset myself.

Any suggestions?",2020-10-21 05:29:46
Alcoholic parent,4,jef51o,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jef51o/alcoholic_parent/,5,1603184222.0,"Hi everyone. I recently joined Reddit and this is my first post. I was wondering if there’s a separate channel for people whose close ones are alcoholics? I apologize in advance if I violate Reddit rules and the following post is considered a wall of text.

I’m 23 and my alcoholic mother (54) has been a burden for me since I was 7. I would come home from school and she wasn’t there. This continued until I was 13 and social services finally took action and I moved in with my single parent half-sister. 

Teenage years weren’t easy either, my sister was only 23 when she became my guardian and had her own issues. I was still neglected.

Mom doesn’t seem to understand the effect her disease has had on me. Either that or she’s in denial. I’ve tried to talk to her about everything, but she only seems to regret the years 2009–2010 when we were evicted. I had already suffered for years. The eviction was harder on her than it was on me.

I worry about my mom multiple times a day and feel sorry for her poor life, which consists of drinking and watching endless re-runs of ”Border Security: Australia’s Front Line” and the Die Hard movie series. That’s it.

Last year I was at Ed Sheeran’s concert on a beautiful summer day in July – our summer isn’t quite long and it might rain a lot – so the day had every opportunity to be full of happiness and lifelong memories, but instead I felt guilty. I felt guilty since my mother has little to no good memories of her life. She’s never had education, traveled or had hobbies or friends.

She gets more depressed if I don’t visit her, but going back to my ”home”town makes me sick to my stomach. All the horrible memories come flooding back and every street or building reminds of a negative thought I had as a child on those corners.

Whenever I meet up with mom, it’s impossible to hold a coherent conversation with her. Alcohol has probably decreased her cognitive abilities and memory. Per se, they’ve always been below average.

I’ve thought about cutting contact with her, but the thought of that makes me even more anxious. She’d still live 20 minutes by train from me and I would always know her life is the exact same way, minus seeing me. My half-sister, now 34 and married with 5 children, lives ten minutes from mom and would most likely tell me how mom’s feeling and what she’s been up to.

I don’t know what to do. As a child I became indifferent after a while. I thought I was a superhuman of some kind and mom’s actions didn’t bother me. I now realize I had just suppressed my feelings.
Today I’m mostly sad and mad at her. In addition I’m jealous of others since I’ll never have a mother. 

Christmas is coming up and I feel obligated to spend it with her, since I don’t know what else she would do. Be alone? Crying? My sister doesn’t want our mother there on Christmas. For the past two years I’ve accommodated my mom on Christmas. I do the grocery shopping and decorations since I have more money and my apartment doesn’t look like a landfill (like my mother’s).

Most of the time I wish my mother would die. That way she wouldn’t be bored. She wouldn’t be depressed or sad. She would just be gone. However, some people get shocked if I say that thought out loud. So instead at times, I wish I would die. That way I wouldn’t be depressed or sad.

I see all the great pictures and videos people have of our planet Earth and know there’s so much to see and experience. But I don’t think I’ll ever fully thrive in my life if I don’t find peace with this issue.

Five years ago I turned 18 and thought my life would somehow change since I had the possibility to do anything I wanted. It didn’t. I’ve already wasted half a decade of adulthood and I’ve done nothing in my life either. I feel like I’m becoming an image of my mom, without the alcoholism.

I’m lost.

TL;DR: I’m anxious, sad and depressed about my alcoholic mom. I wish she’d have a better life, but after 16 years of drinking it seems utopian. I also wish I would know how to turn my own life for the better.",2020-10-20 04:57:02
Is my drinking dilemma typical? If so are there any answers out there?,3,jehynu,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/jehynu/is_my_drinking_dilemma_typical_if_so_are_there/,3,1603194610.0,"Sorry if this breaks rule 2, I'm not asking for any physical medical advice more just life advice.

CONTENT WARNING: depression, self-harm, suicide (no NSFW descriptions)

&#x200B;

I've never had a good relationship with alcohol but it's gotten really bad in the last  year. The thing is, I feel like in many ways most of the things that have driven me to drink have been managed: I've learned *how* to moderate drinking when I chose to, I don't get as socially anxious as I used to (and even then heavy drinking makes that worse), and I don't even like most drinks anymore. I'll sometimes have a moderated drink or two at night, which I understand will have to go if I chose sobriety, but that's not my core issue.

The one thing left that keeps me coming back to intentionally drinking myself into a stupor is my depression and suicidal thoughts. I know that alcohol is a really bad cope, I know it's awful for my health (part of my depression is my rock bottom self image, including my weight, so I know it makes that worse), and has been actively harming my life in ways I'm sure anyone on this sub could relate to. 

But I'd probably be dead if I didn't drink and I can't let that go.

I've attempted suicide before. Before I started drinking heavily it was frequent. The only time after I started that I tried was when I quit. It's not because I think about it less, but because I've never wanted to do it after drinking.

I feel like this is different than impulse control. I feel like when I separate myself from my short-term desires and really look at things I still can't say for sure if quitting drinking will be good for me. Unless I can stop these thoughts I've had for most my life and are awful for reasons outside of drinking I don't know what I can do. With all the bad it brings me, even in my lucid and clear-headed moments I still can't say stopping or even starting to stop would help me.

&#x200B;

I understand that the core issue is my depression, and I don't expect anyone to figure that out for me. I just want to know if this is something anyone else has run into, and if you did do you have answers? I really hate what drinking does and I want to quit but if it's going to kill me I'm not going to be able to commit to that.

My dad was a heavy drinker and I would steal a couple beers here and there and hope he didn't notice. I joined the Marine Corps at 18 and I would have occasional binge sessions because I was young and dumb and wanted to party. I had a DUI that nearly killed me (single motorcycle accident). I just thank God I hurt nobody else. This should have told me to stop. It didn't. I kept drinking. Then my dad passed from cirrhosis. This should have told me to stop. It didn't. After I started drinking almost everyday that I could. I would have occasional periods of sobriety but not much. Some more years go by and I start to feel a pain in my right side. It gradually worsened until I could not sit straight up and had to lean to the opposite side. I went to the ER during covid and was told I had fatty liver with possible progression. My LFT levels were many times higher than they should have been. Every few days I had to get blood work and for several weeksthey got higher even without me drinking. They said it might be liver failure. Then the levels started to come down and finally after several months they returned to normal. A second chance! This should have told me to stop.

I thought my dad was insane for not stopping when he was first told he was starting to kill his liver. He had a warning. He had a second chance. Just stop drinking.

Isolation in Sobriety,6,j7bnh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j7bnh1/isolation_in_sobriety/,14,1602186740.0,"Hello Everyone,

This is a long intro I posted to a support group yesterday, without getting a single reply. It felt amazing to share a bit of my story and journey, but it still left me feeling so alone.

To anyone that takes the time to read it all, I greatly, greatly appreciate you. Thank you!

""Hello,

I am 3 months sober today. I have been sober 9 of the last 13 months. The pandemic gave me an excuse to break, which led to me being in the same old fog of alcoholism, without any of the ""fun"" I used to think there was in it.

I am 34 now, and still remember turning 30 and thinking that I'd finally quit. That I was so lucky to have never gotten a DUI. That I was so lucky to have never killed anyone. That I was so grateful I wasn't going to give myself another opportunity to die.

But, I didn't quit then. I continued living in my comfortable fog of shame, regret, and embarrassment. I would drink every night of the week, blacking out more than half of the time. I would frequently wake up the next morning, peak out the blinds to see if anyone was around, and then ""casually"" walk in circles around my car to see if I hit anything.

When I turned 30, so many areas of my life improved. I was really focused on reading, learning, and practicing being a kinder person to others and myself. The number 3 is my favorite number, and I actually really looked forward to turning 33. I had an honest feeling that it was going to be the best year of my life. I felt that I had been working so hard at it all. My career was getting better and better, and that was in huge part thanks to the drinking and networking.

Leading up to 33, I had started to feel something was really wrong. My blackouts had gotten more intense. I couldn't remember any of the night before. At all. Not even with any hints or reminders. The people, places and phrases were all gone. And then, they kept getting worse. My blackouts were taking memories from before I had even started drinking the night before. I felt that I was killing a part of me and my body was just floating around at night.

I felt so much shame, and embarrassment that I all I wanted to do was drink it away the next night. And I surrounded myself with people that were happy to oblige, but didn't suffer in the same way. I was a happy drunk to them. A kind, sincere, and fun drink. Super empathetic and insightful. Someone they could rely on, as I faded away.

The tipping point was when my mother and brother came out to Austin to visit. It was just the three of us growing up, and it was exciting to have a sense of that again, even though my brother and I hadn't been close in a long time. I had a rough idea of something I was going to propose to them when they got here, but didn't really think they'd go for it.

I didn't have any tattoos and this image kept popping up into my head of 3 hearts overlapping and merging into each other. Different sizes to represent the three of us. Before I could even finish telling them the idea, they had huge smiles on their faces and said, ""let's do it!""

So pounding beers and shots for inspiration, I drew and drew until we had settled on a design we all loved. We went down to the shop, got an estimate, made an appointment, and it felt like we couldn't have been happier.

After that, I took them to the lake to set up hammocks and hang out, and we picked up beer and food on the way. We each got a different 6-pack to try, and I got one with the highest alcohol content.

Lounging in the sun, my 6-pack disappeared. My mom was still sipping on her first one, so I started to move on to the other 5.

I remember being behind the wheel thinking I shouldn't be driving. Thinking that my brother had had too much. That my mother would be anxious and get lost. That I was fighting drifting left, then right, then left, then right. That I was the only one that could get us home. That I absolutely, 100%, should not be driving.

I woke up a few hours later in bed without any memory of getting home. My mom and brother were napping. All was fine, and no one but me knew that I had almost killed us all. I had always known I could kill myself, but I never thought I would take my family down with me. That shook me so incredibly hard, so I drank.

The next day, we got our tattoos. I'd excuse myself to the parking lot to chug beers while it was their turn, and then come back in smiley and glassy eyed. Afterward, we went on a sight seeing boat cruise that I don't remember, but I made my mom drive us home that time.

Their flight was the next day. I was so sad to see them go. I felt like I had finally had the family I had always wanted. The one we didn't really know how to be when we were younger. The kind that just wanted to shower each other with love and ignore any problems or deficiencies.

It was the second time I told my mom I had a drinking problem, and that I didn't want her to worry, and that I was going to work on it. After I dropped them off at the airport, I went home and blacked out.

The next morning, crying all alone, I decided that I was going to start my ""Sober October"" early. It was mid-September. I was dealing with withdrawals right away, and didn't know what to do with myself. I had heard great things about a show called ""The Good Place,"" and decided to throw that on. I didn't stop watching for days. The only time I'd pause it would be if something really pulled me out to cry about. Most of the time, I'd cry while still following the story.

The show gave me so much strength, and compassion and forgiveness toward myself. I became a huge fan of Kristen Bell and the honesty in her character.

After that, I started exploring podcasts. I had already subscribed to a few self-improvement ones, but needed something a bit lighter. I guess podcasting is a small world because I began to notice that the same guests would go on the same top podcasts, and they'd reference each other, and they led me to check out Armchair Expert. Nothing more incredible has happened in my life.

Dax's open honesty about his addiction and recovery, his reckless past and powerful insights, and intense need to be the best person he can be were everything I needed to hear. Being a high functioning person I needed to hear that it was okay to say I fucked up aaaaaaaaall that time, and that I was going to change that now.

Fast forward to this second stint of sobriety and I couldn't be more proud of myself, or more alone. My friendships have exploded now that it's so clear to me that I've allowed myself to be taken advantage of this whole time. That I made it my duty to sacrifice myself for others. That I'll always be there for you, but you'll never have to be here for me. That I will search for and respect your boundaries without you having to say a thing. But after asking you twice, I won't ask a third time for you to stop disrespecting mine, and we'll just ignore it.

Yesterday, in an honest attempt at asking for help and support, I reminded my brother and my mother that today would be 3 months for me. That I was so happy. That I finally feel myself again. I sent them Dax's podcast where he opens up about relapsing after sixteen years, to give them a broader idea of what I'm dealing with. My mother said it was powerful and she had so much to learn, but wanted to support me. My brother didn't reply at all.

Today, neither of them said anything. I don't know that I feel more alone than I've ever felt, but it's much clearer in sobriety to see that I truly am alone. I fostered the wrong relationships all this time and in this bright moment in my life, I have no one to share it with other than my dog, Dax.

But, today, that's more than enough. I actually signed his adoption papers the day I got sober again. I have no urge to drink because my mind is clear, my heart is full, and I am hopeful of the life I'm building every day I wake up sober.

All that to say, I'm here to know that I'm not alone.""",2020-10-08 15:52:20

About 2-3 years back I quit as I felt it was wasting a lot of my time. For the most part I've been just chilling, the occasional (a beer or two every couple of months) but recently (maybe the past couple months) I've been drinking more and more. 

There was a night a couple months back that I drank around 4-5 beers, took a shot and still felt sober. That may not seem like a lot but for someone who doesn't have a high tolerance that freaked me out. 

Im worried I'm going down the same road that I did with weed - it started out with small amounts and escalated from there. I want to keep this under control, any tips/tricks? I want to continue drinking socially but don't like the idea of developing too high of a tolerance or hurting my body",2020-10-18 02:38:24
It is impossible for me to be social without drinking,28,j9tpvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j9tpvp/it_is_impossible_for_me_to_be_social_without/,26,1602547648.0,"So I have had problems with drinking for a fee years, (I'm 27) but can't bring myself to accept alcoholism. I was never the type that needed to drink every single day, or that had abstinence problems, I mostly drank on weekends and days that I felt the need to relax or get away from my anxiety. However I have had dire consequences from it, lost a girlfriend, jobs, embarrassed myself and drank in unacceptable situations. 

This weekend I went to a beach house with some friends, and I noticed that I simply can't be social without a few drinks. I don't talk, I feel embarrassed, judged and my anxiety goes through the roof. So I decided to take a chance and drink, and I was able to control myself. I had a couple beers and a few gin tonics and I felt great. I know this is a very negative reinforcement but it was amazing to feel like part of something and accepted again.

I take anxiety medication, and see a great therapist who has helped a lot, but I still feel like me sober could never be fun, get a girlfriend or have fun again. I just suffer much more if I expose myself to these situations sober, and honestly don't see a way out besides drinking in acceptable amounts.

Most of my thoughts are compulsive and don't resonate with how I want to be as a person. Stuff like extreme romantic jealousy, not being able to accept that I won't be able to move out of my parents' house for at least another few years, thoughts of suicide that come from feeling stuck.

I won't be able to get therapy until like march 2021 and I can't deal with it alone anymore.

When I go to bed, the thoughts just keep going and end up amplifying each other until I get frustrated and angry. I don't look forward to going to bed anymore. Going outside to drink makes me feel free because I'm not in my parents' house and alcohol halts the compulsive thinking.

It's really hard to convince myself right now that alcohol isn't at least a temporary solution. In the past week I've been drunk twice and I genuinely felt good. I'll probably go outside and drink again tonight.

I feel ridiculous typing this stuff out because I know everyone's struggling because of this bleeping pandemic. In a perfect world I'd never even consider using alcohol as a coping mechanism, but nothing else has as strong an effect as alcohol.",2020-10-15 22:55:54

Alcohol can affect your family & friends!

Substance abuse can alienate you in a number of ways, and it may take a toll on the emotions of those around you.

Some ways that addiction can hurt family and friends emotionally include:

* **It can cause trust issues.** It’s difficult to have an addiction and be completely honest about it with those around you. In many cases, people end up stealing from loved ones so they can buy drugs or alcohol. Even in less extreme cases, dishonesty can create space between yourself and your loved ones and cause stress. 
* **It can lead to confrontations.** When dishonesty occurs, tensions run high. It is likely that you will end up in heated conversations with people close to you if your addiction continues. Fights with friends or family members like your siblings, parents, or children can be a huge emotional burden. 
* **Your loved ones know you well.** Let’s face it: it’s difficult to see someone you love going through a hard time, even if it doesn’t affect you directly. Even if you are somehow able to avoid trust issues and confrontations with loved ones, your addiction will likely still take a toll emotionally. 

Your parents might feel like they did something wrong which led to your drug or alcohol use. If you have children, they will probably sense that something isn’t right. This can cause trauma and feelings of neglect that stay with them for years to come.

  
Your loved ones may start to create distance or establish boundaries as a way of protecting themselves emotionally. If you want to save your relationships, you will need to change your behavior.",2020-10-13 14:24:43

For step three, I was prompted to create a sobriety mission plan/ oath/ contract and share it with a trusted individual- here goes nothing. 

Step Three- Committed to a lifestyle of recovery, focusing only on what we could control. 

I started my sober journey on August 26 and so far, the experience has been splendid but I know I will face obstacles. Trail and error is expected in recovery, but I am stronger than my triggers. Alcohol has held its grip on my life for long enough- time to take back control. I want to be free from the depression that was fueled by drinking, and the loneliness that tagged along. By not drinking, I can assure my thoughts are my own and not the lies that alcohol tried to convince me of. 

To continue through my new, recovered life, each day I will wake up with the attitude: *”It’s a beautiful day to not drink.* Alongside my Naltrexone (which helps my cravings) my outlook on alcohol/ sobriety needs to continue to stay sharp. I will continue to take Naltrexone until I am confident in my recovery. I have set a routine that involves work + school (daily), a meeting once a week with girl friends from Freedom Experience, and time to myself on the weekends. I understand that I must actively work towards *not drinking* 

I want to get sober because I want to experience a life worth living. I want to remember and cherish memories that I will continue to make. I want to be sober on my wedding day. I want to take all the money I’m saving and use it to travel the world. I want to make mistakes on my own- ones that look different when not impaired by poison. 

When I have obstacles/ triggers in my sober journey, I will challenge them with tools and forward thinking. I’ll remember back to how I **always** felt the morning after. I don’t ever want to experience that hopeless, self- loathing after a night out again. I have and will continue to set boundaries that protect my sobriety. Nothing- no person, no experience, no drink- is worth more than my well being. Each day I wake up and say “I didn’t drink” is another day to celebrate. 

Being happy is a foreign and beautiful feeling. On my 25th birthday I will celebrate four months sober. What a fucking joy!! The days leading up to may be slow and tedious, but I know they will be worth it.

my brother is having a very difficult time with his drinking. he lost his job due to covid and had to move back in with our mom, where he has taken to spending all day in his room watching tv before he gets drunk by himself. two nights ago, we were hanging out, playing board games and having a couple of drinks. it felt normal and fun and he seemed to be back to himself. an hour later, he began to blame me for ruining all of his relationships. he told me that i ruined everything and swung between sobbing uncontrollably, laughing and then yelling at me. our mutual friends are worried about him, telling me that he gets blackout drunk and upset every time he hangs out with them which isn't often as he does not answer his text messages and does not pick up calls. he has threatened to kill himself once when he was with one of our friends. he lost his drivers license because he hasn't paid a fine, but this can be easily fixed and he hasn't done it so he is stuck at home and can't drive himself to hang out with people.

he has not had an easy life. he is a single dad and the mom of his child lost custody to him due to heroine use (he is not and never has been a user).  he blames himself for this, and blames himself so hard for everything even when it is such a minor infraction...he began to drunkenly sob the other night when he forgot my friend's name, calling himself an embarrassment. i tried telling him that everyone forgets people's names when they first meet, tried being calm. minutes later he was jovially talking to me, and then minutes after that he got upset again. i live across the country from my family, and i am just on a week vacation to visit. from what i have heard, this isn't the only time this has happened, but i am not here most of the time.

my mom has not taken action and i don't want to agitate him into doing something stupid. alcoholism runs in my family: my dad lost custody of us as children because he was such an intense alcoholic and after 20 years of sobriety he was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and hepatitis c, which he has now recovered but very nearly died from.  no one has gotten hurt, but i worry about his daughter who he is barely spending time with because he's isolating himself so hard. i don't know what to do to help him and i need some suggestions. he's my brother and i can't stand by while he does this, but i don't want to send him spiraling and i need my parents to help since i can't be here. i'm open to suggestions, thank you.",2020-10-04 21:20:37

Drinking during pandemic and strange odor,10,izev7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/izev7l/drinking_during_pandemic_and_strange_odor/,12,1601045888.0,"Hello. I’m new here and have been reading so many posts and learning more about alcoholism and would like to ask for some advice on something that has been happening to me for the pandemic started but especially the last few weeks.

I have a drinking prob. I’ve known it for many years. Started drinking when I was 18 and went through a phase of heavy drinking while in college. I am now 37. I’ve never been too concerned with my drinking because I go through stages of it and sometimes go for long periods of time without drinking. I realize that does not change anything and still makes me an alcoholic. Most of my drinking happened in social settings and on weekends when I went out with my friends during my late twenties and I’ve always been able to maintain a job, pay my bills, and for the most part have great relationships with my family. I’ve never someone who craves a drink or can’t go without one. Never drink at work and had the need to hide my drinking habits. The main issue I had was that once I starting drinking I drank until I passed out which often led to some very embarrassing situations. 

In my early 30s I got really depressed and my drinking habits changed again. For the most part it was only during weekend nights but I was now doing it alone to numb myself from my depression. Eventually things got better and that got better.

Then the pandemic happened. I began to work from home in March and due to the stress and worry for family, loneliness, boredom, I began to drink more and more during the evenings after work. What started off as a bottle of wine every other night turned into every night and I would feel better about myself and found myself worrying less and having fun even. Two weeks they said, and this would go way. Eventually I moved on to vodka and die the last couple of months I’ve been drinking 3/4 of a 750Ml of vodka every night almost and staying up til 2-3 am. I will still get up in time and work my 8-5 and lately since the cases have gone down I’ve been going out a bit more and even seeing a friend or two and family but when I come home in the evening the drinking starts and It is taking it’s toll on me and I’ve had enough. Constant heartburn and bloating and feeling and looking tired has me feeling very ashamed of myself and have decided this is escalating and could get out of control.

Another thing that I’ve noticed that is driving me insane is this strange horrible odor that I’ve started noticing a couple of weeks ago. It smells pungent/sour... can’t really describe it but it can smell it in some parts of the house like my bedroom and in living room where I work out of. At first I thought maybe my dog had hidden something and was going bad, then I thought it was coming from the AC vents and even went as far as thinking it was mold or a prob with the house but it’s also on my clothes and I don’t know what to do and starting to think it’s me which is very embarrassing because I’m a clean person who doesn’t like a dirty house and bathe twice a day. I confided in a friend and she thinks it’s the smell from the vodka I drink but I can confirm it is not. I saw a post on here in which someone was complaint about a smell as well but didn’t have many responses so wanted to ask if anyone is having this issue and if so will it stop once I eventually stop drinking?I feel like it’s sticks to everything and can would hate to think it’s coming from me but can’t think of any other reason. Someone else mentioned people who are going through detox often sweat more and the odor can be worse than normal whoever I haven’t been in detox or withdrawal. Any ideas please? 

Normally I would be drinking right now but decided that today will be the day I stop and start being better to myself. I honestly do not feel the urge to drink whatsoever and just thinking about it makes me feel sick. I can’t say that I will stop drinking for the rest of my life but I plan to see small goals for myself like start with a month of not drinking and go from there. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to vent and any advise will be greatly appreciated.",2020-09-25 10:58:08
Day 139 and missing my nightly beers...,10,iz9tkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iz9tkt/day_139_and_missing_my_nightly_beers/,3,1601024327.0,"First off, I want to start by saying I am not going to have a drink today. 

I made a commitment to stop drinking in May. Quarantine has been a blessing and a curse in a lot of ways. I am one of the lucky people who got to keep their job, and I work from home. So quarantine has just been months and months of isolation and introspection. 

In March and April, I noticed my drinking going up dramatically. I was drinking at least a bottle of gin every week or so, in addition to beer. I used to think of myself as just a social drinker, drinking to alleviate social anxiety. But I was doing this alone in my room. 

The truth is, I'm an anxiety drinker. I drink when I feel anxious, which is most of the time because I have an anxiety disorder. That anxiousness got worse during the first few months of quarantine, and so the drinking got worse, naturally. 

After I lost a friend who I only met in person two or three times due to drunk me coming on to her via text, I decided that the situation had become dire. I made a commitment and I have been sticking to it with the help of AA, this sub, Taoism, and a strict daily routine. 

However, tonight as I sit near my open window and feel autumn on the wind, I start to remember my life ""before"" fondly. My life before quarantine, before the endless repetitive days, before I had to make such a rigid schedule just to survive, before beer was off-limits. I know memory tends to have rose-tinted glasses, but I'm surprised by this feeling. I've had cravings loads of times since I quit, sure. A craving is like a wave you ride out, holding your ground as if you are in a massive tidepool, distracting yourself as much as you can without letting it tip you over. This is something else. This is *bittersweet nostalgia.* 

I don't know how to flag this post. Perhaps its just a dear diary, or reaching out into the void with feelings I need to write out to understand. I can handle cravings, but this lovelorn longing for booze is something new and confusing. Thanks for being here, guys.",2020-09-25 04:58:47
Is getting better about drinking keeping me from getting better about drinking?,1,j3gjcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j3gjcv/is_getting_better_about_drinking_keeping_me_from/,8,1601612717.0,"I have thought about posting here for months. I'm worried I'll be seen as controversial and divisive, or worse, that I am not acting in good faith. I really am trying to stop drinking, though, at least for a sustained period of time.

Here are the issues I am running into with my sobriety.

For a while, I drank basically daily, sometimes just 3-5 drinks, sometimes much heavier binging. Honestly, I have probably been a binge drinker (that variety of alcoholic) with periods of more intense daily drinking for the past 13 years or so.

Anyway, since Covid, I have done so much better! I no longer drink daily. Usually closer to every other day, with some weeks where I drink a couple days in a row or abstain for a few.

The first day is usually pretty easy. Since I don't drink daily anymore, I don't really get withdrawals, my hangovers are usually not bad (provided I eat the night before), and I'm even getting better at having a few and stopping myself from continuing.

However, I still binge at least a couple nights a week, sometimes up to 4 nights (about a 6 drinks to a pint of hard alcohol on those days).

The hardest moment for me is nearing the 48 hour mark.

The time begins to crawl and I try to tell myself to do anything but go to the liquor store, but it's so hard when the other voice is saying ""you're just getting a few shooters to pass the time, look how much better you are doing! It's ok to drink in moderation, that's what you are learning how to do!"" -- And that is some poor rationalization

The improvement is consistent and has lasted most of the year, I just wish I could push past that 48 hr mark regularly and make it to a week or a month.

The most controversial part of my post is coming up next:

Please don't recommend AA. I have no issue with therapy, or support groups, but I have a huge issue with AA's philosophy toward surrender and metaphysical belief, and many of the steps seem a bit cult like to me. There is also this situation- I don't really act out much when I drink. Sure, I've drank my roommate's booze during a bad bender, but that's about as bad as it has gotten. I don't have big ammends to make. I mostly know to keep to myself in that mode.

I looked into SMART recovery- it also said it had some steps, but I couldn't actually find what they were- if someone knows I would love to hear what they are.

I am very skeptical of organizations that offer help to people who are desperate for spiritual, emotional fulfillment that they are not getting in their lives and looking for in all the wrong places because I have had bad experiences with other institutions that cater to that crowd and I know how easily they can mess you up.

I am definitely not interested at all in AA for those reasons.

But I would love some kind of situation where I can talk and while away the time while I wait for my partner to come home from his 12+ hr days while I am at home alone.

It's between 3-6pm MST when time begins to stand still, and we're about to round the bend.

I guess I am hoping someone might have some suggestions.",2020-10-02 00:25:17

**What's your analysis of the following comment?**

""As a brain scientist let me just say that most brain scientists don't know shit about alcoholism or addiction. They look at it from a strictly pharmacological perspective, seeing dependence and tolerance strictly in terms of receptor half-lives binding constants.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor\_(biochemistry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry))

Yes, that plays a role, but it is actually a very minor part of recovery. Alcoholism is a thinking disorder whose major symptom is drinking. As long as drinking is maintained, then thinking cannot change. But remove alcohol, and underlying problems are exposed and can now be addressed. Early on I was discussing serenity prayer with my sponsor, and I asked what ""wisdom"" was, and he replied that it was "" ability to recognize a mistake as we are making it again."" What sobriety makes possible is opportunity to do things differently. We still make mistakes, but we start to stop them earlier in process.

Our alcoholic behavior is really just a set of established reflexes that respond to cues, so a big part of recovery is identifying those cues and then choosing a different pathway to avoid them. In recovery we have two opposing forces. bad one is biochemical and behavioral draw of alcohol and ""alcohol lifestyle."" To counter this we first remove alcohol, and then we alter lifestyle (not forever, but for at least as long as alcohol has its cunning, baffling, and powerful influence over our thinking processes) to one which is better. thing is, THIS is a daunting task. When we first look upon challenges ahead, we see them as being too great, and a return to bottle is just way easier and less painful. If we drank to reduce anxiety, this becomes really frustrating because anxiety is likely to go off scale when we stop drinking. But it does get better, and this is why I tell those new in recovery to be patient. Give it some time. challenge though becomes easier when we break it down into smaller units, which is point that these and all of other researchers seem to miss. We don't need to get completely better overnight. We can get just a little better each day, and slowly over time those days begin to add up.

I liken alcoholics to cats. bottle is our can opener, and we all know how long it takes a cat to stop reacting to can opener. We also know that second we give cat some food after using can opener, entire behavioral extinction process starts over on day 1. So it is with us drunks. We have these deeply ingrained synaptic pathways that have been reinforced daily for years. Unfortunately it takes a long time for them to disappear (or at least lose their strength) through disuse. This process can, however, be sped up a bit by simultaneously replacing them with new behaviors or activities. wisdom of AA is that pretty much every strategy to do this has been tried and tested. For those who started to drink right after work, solution was often going straight to a meeting and not to bar. We all have needs that need to be met, and one of those is companionship. If we go home rather than bar, we have removed alcohol from equation, but at same time we have also lost our source for companionship. Successful recovery doesn't come just from removing alcohol, it comes from replacing alcohol with a better strategy to fulfill need that alcohol was providing. So a meeting acts to provide companionship but in an alcohol-free environment. And it is hard to think about drinking if you are distracted by actually doing something else.

If alcohol is removed, physical pathology will likely reverse over same time course because for most part it is simply a biochemical process. That is what scientists are measuring. What ODAT approach gives, though, is a means by which one can maintain motivation to keep going. AA doesn't say go to 90 meetings, it suggests 90 meetings in 90 days. Going to 90 meetings in 10 days doesn't provide that much more benefit. It is 90 days that matters, and staying motivated to do 90 days. Probably half of posts here are about problems with motivation to keep going. So listen to those with time who say it is worth effort, because they are proof that it can be overcome. Stopping drinking is actually easy. But stopping drinking and not going bat-shit nutz is a bigger challenge. All of scientists, and most of doctors, that I have worked with over years see addiction problem purely as a pharmacological model. What they are looking at, though, is really de-tox problem. Once receptors have been stabilized back to baseline, which is rarely more than 30 days max, depending on regeneration half-life, their contribution is over. That 28 day treatment model isn't just a coincidental number. But those of us in recovery know that 30 days is just beginning of interesting part, where thinking needs to change.""

"Mom’s got a drinking problem, sister (24f) who has a new baby (7moF) and has always depended on and still lives with mom is struggling to deal with said problem. I removed myself years ago but feel the need to intervene as things continue to escalate.",6,j30uxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j30uxz/moms_got_a_drinking_problem_sister_24f_who_has_a/,5,1601551339.0,"Some general history: My family has been through a lot. My (26F) dad died a decade ago in a motorcycle accident, my brother died five years ago at the age of 23 from a drug overdose after being incarcerated or in juvie/boarding school most of his life. That leaves my mom (57) and my sister (24) who have been struggling along through it all. We have no extended family close by, used to see some once a year and generally stay in touch with my dads extended family through social media. We also lost a cousin 5 years ago to a life long heart defect, he was 18, and our grandmother 7 years ago. My mom’s parents both died when she was young of heart attacks, mom when she was 16 and dad when she was 3. She had a step dad who raised her after that, who died when she was 30. 

Growing up my parents always drank, my brother got into drugs and alcohol young and spiraled into incarceration, I also got into substances and have had my own issues but was the “good student” who “made it out”. I remember my parents having some drunken fights growing up, and my mom going to drink with her friends most nights. After my dad died, i disconnected even more, while also being the one who kept my family together. I have always played the middle man, mediator, centering force for my family, even though I have suffered from extreme anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I can put on the face, if you will. 

My mom started dating and then married a man 7 years ago. He’d been sober his entire life due to family issues with alcoholism and general disinterest. This was never a huge point of concern, though he really didn’t like my moms drinking habits. I always chalked it up to him “not being a drinker”. After my brother died, my mom went through a serious bout of depression, and seemingly fell off the deep end into the pits of alcohol and despair. Within a year of his death, her husband left her. She said his reasons for leaving were primarily her drinking, the vicious things she would say while drunk, and that she wouldn’t “put god first, him second, and the children third”. It was messy. 

My sister has always been somewhat immature, explosive, and distant. She loves horses and animals, currently has 3 horses, 2 cats and 2 dogs. She rented a barn for a long time and managed it, but never has held a steady job and goes through money like crazy. We had received some money from my dad passing which went into her animals, but that quickly ran dry and she fell back on my mom for financial support. She’s always lived with my mom, moved out a few times but never lasted more than a few months. She’s been living in the family room of the extra building of my mom’s. Her boyfriend has lived there too for the last year plus, and they had a child in February. 

My sister and mom have always butted heads and had a very toxic, explosive, destructive, confusing relationship. They communicate through snide remarks, yells, low cuts and belittlement. Both of them have a lot of unaddressed trauma and awful characteristics because of it. I’ve struggled with them for as long as I can remember, moved out as soon as i could, and never came back. They generally only contact me if something happens between them. They love to bring me into the middle of it and pit me against each other. 

Lately, things have escalated immensely. My mom seems to be drunk, all the time. Whenever i see or talk to her no matter what time of day she’s drunk or drinking. She drives drunk, drinks while driving (has done this on the way to visit me before), and according to my sister has gone to work after drinking (she is an Rn in an emergency based lab). She gets excessively emotional when drinking. Whenever i see or talk to her lately, she goes through immense anger, to immense sadness, and everything in between. She has called me heartless, told me I don’t care about her or our family, that I must think I’m too good for her and hate her, to her being proud of me and who I am, and jealous that I have it so together, to confused why I don’t come around, to that she is worthless and doesn’t matter and shouldn’t be here or should just leave, and around and around in circles. I’ve seen this in her before, but never as frequently as of late. 

Things seem to be coming to a head with my sister, too. Mom claims my sister is using her for money, won’t participate in housework, but that mom cant kick her out because they have a child and she cant afford it. This is true, my sister cant afford to live on her own because she barely works due to childcare and boyfriends income goes largely to support another child he fathered (which is a whole other long story). What money they have left go towards general living expenses, and boarding for her horses who are honestly more important to her than us living family. I’ve tried to talk her into temporarily rehousing her animals, so she can get on her feet, but she freaks out on me and blocks me whenever i bring it up. My sisters claims are that my mom is an unstable alcoholic who is erratic and crazy, but she needs her help and support. She says she doesn’t trust her with her child, and that my mother has very rarely paid attention to the baby either which upsets her. 

My moms friends suck, and encourage her drinking and poor lifestyle. She has a boyfriend of a few months who is 44 and has a 9 yr old son, and seems to be kind of a piece of shit too. She’s got a whole string of guys she’s seen over the last few years, all of which kind of suck imo, mostly drunks, etc. Some have gotten her into dangerous situations, car accidents, etc. She pays for everything for her friends and men it seems like. She seems desperate for love, acceptance, someone to value her. It’s sad to watch, but I truly don’t know what to do. 

The most recent incident happened last week, during what was supposed to be my sisters birthday dinner. My sister did chores at the barn and arrived to the restaurant, only to find two of my moms friends and someone she didn’t know, my mom wasn’t there yet. My sister got upset and left, as she didn’t want to have a birthday dinner with my mom drinking with her friends. My moms boyfriend took it upon himself to text my sister telling her to apologize, even though he wasn’t there nor had anything to do with the situation. Two days later, my sister brought up the situation which led to an argument and my mom saying she was evicting her and taking her truck back (mom co-signed a lease) and calling the bank to take the truck etc. The threatening eviction and truck scenario come up frequently lately, also. Mom has also called the cops on my sister for a variety of things, most of which are unfounded or a stretch, over the last year or so. 

Literally, what the fuck can I do to help this absolute shit show? I’m kind of afraid of both of them, very concerned about both of them, have been talking to my sister more than mother recently, who wont accept any financial support from me which is understandable, but I’m at a loss! I would like to sit down and talk with my mom about things, tell her I think the drinking has become a problem, that she needs help and support outside what she is getting. I’m afraid to do so, don’t know who i could involve to help. I’ve tried to talk her into getting a therapist to talk things through, tried to talk both of them into it, but both are immensely resistant. I don’t want my remaining family members to kill each other or die due to their bullshit and honestly that’s what it feels like could happen at any moment....

Quitting drinking at 18,10,j0rg67,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j0rg67/quitting_drinking_at_18/,8,1601243563.0,"I am an 18 year old girl who drinks about 3-4 nights every week, and can only have a good time or be social if I am drunk. I day drink once a week as well. I wouldn’t call myself an alcoholic, but I depend on alcohol to be social and enjoy being around people. Every morning after I drink, I regret something I said. I always embarrass myself and say shit I shouldn’t say. I miss having connections with people while I’m sober. 

I have been drinking at the rate that I do, on and off, since I was 16. It definitely got more frequent during quarantine and when I moved out. I went through a breakup from a 3 year relationship last month, where I had to move back home to my parents, and it’s been a downhill slope ever since then. 

My parents are both alcoholics and I am a lot like them where I cannot have fun without drinking. They have been drinking and partying multiple times a week since I was a really young child and it’s also gotten worse. I’m starting to realize the learned behaviour around alcohol.

I am quitting drinking all together because I feel like I need to reestablish my confidence and sociableness that I had before I relied on drinking. I need to learn how to be in a social situation without having a few drinks and make friends who I want to be around when I am sober. I really do not want to become a bad alcoholic like my parents, grandparents, and many other family members are. This is also a step in my spiritual journey.

Liter a day to FIVE years sober,48,j2d6xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j2d6xo/liter_a_day_to_five_years_sober/,6,1601460246.0,"5!

On September 28th 2015 I was found in my room by my Dad by chance and it would change everything. 911 was called but before anyone got there I remember taking one more sip and saying to myself ""this is the last shot i'll take, whether I live or die""

The police and paramedics, doctors and nurses saw a 23 year old very near his end. None of whom thought I would survive the night. They certainly didn't believe why I was 105 pounds and dark yellow at such an age. I was drinking a liter of vodka a day. Regardless, they did their job, they gave me a blood transfusion and took very close care of me and in a month managed to save my life. 

From Stage 4 cirrhosis/failure of the liver, Stage 3 hepatic encephalopathy, heavy jaundice, needing a transplant and in an extremely altered state. My addiction had taken it's toll, but Death recieved no such satisfaction. 

On October 24th 2015 I was released to go home and continue the battle, one I literally didn't know was coming. Doctors told me ""six months"" of no drinking and i'll be on the transplant list. For the next two and a half months, while I was actually conscious now, my altered state continued and manifested itself in memory loss and both auditory and visual hallucinations. 

Then on December 3rd, back in the hospital for overnight tests, I was told my liver had begun regeneration. After that I took my medication to clean my blood, finally started to eat again and suddenly I woke up one day in early January 2016. Took a shower, put on my favorite Iron Maiden shirt and went to the doctor. Only this time I was finally ""awake"" and aware of everything. My skin was back to normal, I had gained weight and my encephalopathy or altered state was gone. I had officially survived and conquered the first and biggest steps. Stay alive and get sober. Now the everlasting task of staying sober. 

I had a ton of doctors to visit over the coming months and years but with each appointment my liver just kept getting better and better until the words ""liver transplant"" were thankfully a forgotten phrase. The lasting effects and damage I have caused not only to myself but to my friends and to my family are a sharp point both in my addiction and in my sobriety. It is a hard reminder of what I had done. 

But I am pleased to say that today, the 29th of September 2020, in this horrible year, I mark a very proud moment in celebrating FIVE years sober. My life was saved, I survived and I continue to live, and though I have permanent nerve damage in my eyes, legs and feet, it is far better than what could have been.

If you have read this far, I thank you. Please if you or someone you know is struggling with addiction tell them my story and to please not go this far. I blacked out most of that final year and can't remember much before the hospital so I did not know to get help or how. I used alcohol as a medicine and know others use drugs the same way. Maybe this will help others to know it's never too late, you can break addiction and live again. 


I was asked by my Father on that final day, ""do you want to die?"". I said, no.

So I’ve began noticing a slight pain, almost unnoticeable, in my liver area the day after drinking. Honestly not sure if it has anything to do with drinking or maybe it’s just me being paranoid.

How problematic is my mother’s drinking?,7,j1ofwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j1ofwe/how_problematic_is_my_mothers_drinking/,6,1601367715.0,"My mom hasn’t been handling quarantine too well. She’s depressed and agitated a lot, and drinking has become her main coping mechanism. Apparently back in March she drank almost every night, and she and my dad agreed to limit drinking to weekends to get it back under control. She counted Fridays through Sundays as weekends, but still mostly stuck to it.

Fast forward to September when she’s started her new job as an online teacher and is under constant stress from trying to handle all the unfamiliar platforms. At this point, she’d already given up on keeping drinking to weekends, but now she drinks pretty much every day from what I can tell. Sometimes she’ll start as early as 4-4:30 pm. About every second or third night, she’ll get drunk enough that it’s pretty obvious. She doesn’t generally yell, but she’ll start arguments that don’t make sense and will firmly believe that she’s the only one who knows what’s going on. In reality, she’ll be talking about something that is only vaguely relevant to the discussion at hand and doesn’t understand how what anyone else says is relevant.

She’s posted a few times on Facebook complaining about her job stress and adding comments or hashtags at the end joking about how this is why she needs to drink more.

Any chance to escape from this?,3,iym1lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iym1lv/any_chance_to_escape_from_this/,4,1600933243.0,"TL;DR: I have some issues (health? dunno) caused by drinking. My main issue right now is that after every sleep, I feel like I can't breath. I also want so ask for advice on several other issues about quitting. Down bellow.

\*this post was made a while ago when it was 6AM. Now it's just 1.40AM when I'm posting it.

First of all, I am sorry for all the grammar mistakes. Not my native language and I've learned it myself as best as I could.

I am almost 40. And yes, this is a new account (many friends know my main account).

Ok. Let's dig in.

It's 6AM in here, I am awake since 4 AM because my schedule is fucked up. It was bad, but the lockdown and all things related to Covid-19 fucked it up because before that, I was not drinking in the mornings or during the day.

I am drinking quite a lot for about 8 years now. By then, I will not say I didn't do it at all. But rarely I had more than one beer / week. 8 years ago I lost my job and while I was at home I started to drink more and more beers. Moving forward, around 4 years ago I was at around 4 to 6 beers / evening. Around two years ago, it was 10-12 beers/day, sometimes some in mid day (starting with 10-11 AM).

Beers got me gaining a lot of weight and I switched to whisky. By the end of 2019, I was at around 50 to 75% of a whisky bottle / day + 1 or two beers almost daily. In some days I was having 1 bottle of whisky in a few hours.

Since April this year, I am drinking 1.5 to 2 bottles / day. Here's the drill:

\- I wake up early (because I sleep during the day too), I have a coffee and after an hour I start to have whisky. I am also working so I try to limit it. But I go around 75% of the bottle. At around 13:00-14:00 I go to sleep for 1-4 hours. It depends.

\- I wake up again in the evening and I usually start with a beer

\- I continue with at least one full bottle of whisky and then I go to sleep.

This is the full context. Now, the issues.

Around 16 days ago, I woke up in the morning and I felt like I cannot breathe properly. I wasn't feeling oxygenated. I tried to do deep breathe in and I've seen I can take it, but I still felt like I am not breathing enough. I have stayed in bed for 30 minutes more. Woke Up. The shortness of breath kept intensifying and I was unable to lay down or stay in a chair. I was walking up and down the house, sweating and breathing heavily. I was unable or afraid to talk because I was only focusing on breathing.

After 2-3 hours, I have started to feel dizzy, feel like I was about to faint in the next second. So I rushed to Emergency. In there (I am currently in a country and I don't speak the language, they rarely speak English). The lady there said 'no English', I wasn't able to speak so I pointed to my lungs, trying to show her I cannot breathe. So she sent me to the Covid-19 ER. The doctor took me right away, he was speaking English. He said: pulse normal, a bit too high blood pressure but nothing worrying. He sent me to do a CT scan. No sign of the virus. So he sent me home.

Three days later, I ended up again in the ER. But this time they were speaking English and I told them all my symptoms: shortness of air, I felt like my chest is contracting, I felt my heard beating in my stomach and sometimes in the whole body, shaking/shivering, sweating, numb hands and sometimes even my feet. They rushed me in to check for some heart attack/failure. So I got connected to two machines and in a few seconds he told me: heart is perfectly fine.

I explained to the doctor that I am not the type of person to go to a medic and now I am twice in ER in a few days. Something is very wrong. So he kept me connected to those things for like 6 hours to monitor any strange activity. Nothing strange happened. During this time, they took blood from my veins and from artery for tests.

After 6 hours, another doctor came and she asked me: Do you drink? I said yes, heavy.  She said: I know, I can see it in your blood. How heavy? I don't know why I said about 75% of a bottle of whisky / day.

She said I am perfectly fine, heart is fine, lungs are fine, liver is fine but really unhappy. And she said I need to have a family doctor to give me a prescription and to monitor me with blood tests every few days to make sure I am not drinking while I take the pills.

So I wanna know: Anyone else is having or had this problem? It absolutely destroys my ability to do anything during the day. I cannot sit or think while I have it and I have it every time I wake up. Can it be alcohol withdrawal after just a few hours a sleep? In some days I am panicking. However, I am destroyed by this because I have to start drinking as soon as I wake up. Just to be able to sit and work something.

Now, regarding getting some medical help. Fuck me, things are complicated. I have to schedule myself through a website with a 'general medic' and set him as family doctor (I had no idea I need one). After, he will do my blood test, give me prescription and monitor me. At the same time, I am thinking of going to a psychologist. But the thing is, I got canceled 3 times already by the general doctors I've made appointments to. I need to do it with the ones that are speaking English and they are in vacation. So after 2 weeks since my last visit to ER, I am still trying.

I am also wondering if I haven't went way too far and I would be better of if I get myself in a clinic for a few weeks.  What would you suggest?

EDIT: Since I wrote this (about 3-4 weeks ago), I went to a family doctor. I told him how much I drink and how I feel after I sleep because alcohol withdrawal. He was like 'a, chill, it's np'. I give you pills to cut appetite and pills in case you go bananas. You can still drink but you will drink 4 times less. I have to say, it didn't inspire me too much confidence. Now I am searching for a rehab center. Alcohol withdrawal can come with some nasty shit. Like hallucinations, delirium tremens etc.

How do I find my higher power?,5,izaqa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/izaqa2/how_do_i_find_my_higher_power/,6,1601027802.0,"
Ok. So let me start of by saying that I'm not an alcoholic, so I don't know if I'm allowed to post here, but I thought that if anyone knows about higher powers it's you guys.

I'm struggling to escape a wildy toxic and narcissistic mother and I'm beginning to realize that I cannot do it alone. Overr the course of the last few weeks, I've managed to become 100% isolated except via social media, but I do have a goal in mind and I usually try to peruse that in order to stay sane: I want to buy and settle in to a new house so that I can go no contact. However, I don't think this is my higher power because I don't draw any strength from it. 

I've been turning to social media and it's been a good place to get advice, rant, and check in, but this doesn't make me feel in control. If anything, it makes me more likely to lose control because after having reached out to my family and being dejected even more, I am tempted to just publish everything online for the world to see because I feel like I have nothing to lose. However, a public move like that could be just what she (and her nest of vipers) need to kick me out of the house, at which point I will be homeless and unable to go no-contact.  

The other place I normally turn is books and information. This also helps me self-check and also helps with the isolation coz it reminds me that how I feel is not unique and frankly, normal or reasonable for someone who is experiencing what I am. I've considered ""no contact"" as my higher power, but frankly, that's the opposite of what I need because its lonely and I can't possibly imagine that. I do not want a family because I would rather die a thousand deaths and be rocketed into the sun than make another human being feel so poorly and be too broken to realize it. In fact, I had an abortion for this exact reason because I knew that my child would be exposed to the toxic sludge that is my mother and  couldn't bear the thought of them feeling as unloved and unwanted as I have for a single minute in their lives. But sadly, this also means that there is no child (aborted or future) to live for as my higher power and frankly, I dont even know if I like kids.

Anyway, I'm so lost and feel so small right now that everything feels like it should be my higher power. Please help.

Update: thanks for letting me rant here. My mother isn't even an alcoholic she's just really, really, hateful toward me. Your comments did help. I think right now Reddit is my higher power because here's so much support!  Good luck to all of you with your recoveries. :)",2020-09-25 05:56:42
looking for advice on how to best support a friend,1,j1avsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/j1avsu/looking_for_advice_on_how_to_best_support_a_friend/,2,1601324143.0,"Hello all. I am looking for advice and resources on how best to support one of my best friends in her battle against alcoholism. She was going to AA and had stopped drinking after getting her first DUI/DWI. I was so proud of her. 

Then she and her husband spit. He is an alcoholic too and not in recovery so I think it was a healthy choice for her. However, this happened just before COVID. Lockdown happened. My BFF's father died. Her FIL (a very positive influence in her life) died. And she is now off the wagon and has been candid about this to me.

I love her like a sister. And given the circumstances, I actually think that her reaction to all this stress is normal, I am worried about her. I am also worried that I am saying the wrong things to support her. I keep encouraging her to call her sponsor but also validate that drinking more is a pretty normal reaction to the situation. That said, I keep worrying that she will end up getting another DUI/DWI or harm herself in other ways. I know that I am not responsible for her choices but I also do not want to become an enabler. 

What can I do to help her, support her, and love her without enabling her disease? Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit. And, if it is, can anyone point me in the right direction? Thank you.",2020-09-28 16:15:43
"Normal LFTs and other bloodwork – still have concerns... (30/M/5'8""/160lbs)",2,iz8gp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iz8gp9/normal_lfts_and_other_bloodwork_still_have/,2,1601019326.0," 

Let me start off by saying that I am a pretty severe hypochondriac, I have convinced myself that I have been dying of just about every illness imaginable.

I also like to drink, and when I do drink, I do not generally do so in moderation (up to 20 bud lights in a sitting).

For about the last ten years, I was a ""weekend warrior"" at the end of most weeks. I have also been extremely active during that time: weight lifting, running, etc., and I have always eaten fairly healthy. Over the past two to three years or so, the weekends have began spilling into the weeks, though I wouldn't usually drink nearly as much when it did, as I looked to cope with some of the stressors facing me in the military.

In October 2018, at 28 years old, I had routine bloodwork done after complaining of a minor ache in my right side during a check-up. It was as follows:

4.9 g/dL Albumin (3.5-5.5)  
45 UL ALP (36-126)  
**86 UL ALT (7-56)**  
**105 UL AST (17-49)**  
**1.5 mg/dL Bilirubin (0.2-1.3)**  
**6 mg/dL BUN (9-21)**  
**97 mmol/L Chloride (98-107)**  
0.90 mg/dL Creatinine (0.8-1.5)  
**75 mg/dL Glucose (76-110)**  
3.7 mEq/L Potassium (6.3-8.2)  
7.8 g/dL Protein (6.8-8.2)  
142 mmol/L Sodium (137-145)  
115.0 mL/min eGFR Non-Black (>59)  
133.0 mL/min eGFR Black (>59)

As a hypochondriac, I freaked out, but my doctor performed a (percussion?) test on my liver, said I did not have signs of swelling, told me that because of the AST/ALT ratio it was unlikely due to alcohol, told me to cut out the supplements I was taking (a few mild testosterone boosters for the weight lifting), and told me to come back in three weeks for a Hepatic Function Panel.

I did, and everything was pretty normal:

4.4 g/dL Albumin (3.5-5.5)  
39 UL ALP (36-126)  
38 UL ALT (7-56)  
39 UL AST (17-49)  
1.3 mg/dL Bilirubin (0.2-1.3)  
**0.6 mg/dL Bilirubin Direct (0.0-0.4)**  
7.3 g/dL Protein (6.3-8.2)

\*Note: I continued my regular drinking habits with exception to about five days before the test, but the ache had subsided\*

I was still worried, after reading horror stories on reddit and the like, about how ""you can still have major liver disease even with normal bloodwork,"" so I cleaned up my drinking... a bit. Until this whole quarantine hit, then I was at it most days, until one day that pain, which was less of a pain and more of an awareness, returned and my eyes just looked awful (not at all yellow, but bloodshot and cloudy). I decided it was time for a substantial break, I took a month off, and then went for bloodwork, this time a more comprehensive panel, and everything was totally normal (aside from slightly high cholesterol and slightly elevated blood pressure – which I usually have at the doctor's office, you know, the hypochondriac thing).

When my doctor called, I was relieved at the results, though for some reason during the appointment when I told her about my drinking, I had mentioned that it was only two weeks since I had last drank, rather than a month. She told me that my liver and kidney function was great, and that I needed to get back into working out (I had let quarantine give me an excuse not to), cut back on fatty proteins and my drinking, and to return in three months.

Needless to say, I took this as permission to drink with reckless abandon. Though I was usually limiting myself to the weekends, and I was taking a week or two off at a time here and there. Eventually, I got that pain/awareness again, and my eye, again, looked awful, but still, not yellow. And this time was a bit different, because I had an instance where I had thick, dark urine during the middle of the day after a night of drinking; having said that, full disclosure all that I had to drink that day was a cup of 24 oz coffee and an energy drink, which I never drink, for some reason. I was prepared to go to the emergency room, but after taking down about a half gallon of water, my urine returned to normal (it is almost always clear, seldom even very yellow), so I decided it could wait until my follow-up appointment, which was in two weeks. I abstained from drinking during the two weeks leading up to the appointment.

At the follow-up, I straight up told her that I took my last appointment as permission to continue drinking like a fool, and I told her about the dark urine, she ran some follow-up tests and again... all normal, my cholesterol even improved.

It has been a month since my last test, I have drank over two of the weekends, again, pretty heavily. I have had that same pain return after the most recent, this past weekend, and the ugly, hungover eyes. I have become so paranoid over this that it consumes much of my free time. I am constantly checking my eyes, taking photos with different lighting, feeling for my liver (I honestly think I bruised a rib doing so, because it went from an awareness to a pain, that has since subsided, the other day), doing that percussion, tapping thing that the doctor had done on me, spending time on google/reddit, looking up symptoms, convincing myself that I have those symptoms (e.g. my skin is pretty itchy after I shower due to the hard water and heat, it sets me into a panic, or I find a pimple on my chest and I become convinced it is a spider angioma, spreading my eyes so far apart to see what discoloration I can see beyond what is visible outside the eyelid, etc).

I don't know what I am looking for here, I just thought maybe someone would understand.

TL/DR: I am convinced that I am dying of liver disease despite countless normal blood tests and my doctor telling me that I am healthy because of a pain, or a ""liver awareness,"" and bloodshot eyes that I get occasionally when I overindulge.",2020-09-25 03:35:26

I am 54 and sober for ten months. I lost my job due to COVID-19 like millions of others, in April. Nowadays you have to pass a detailed background check to get hired at almost every job. Any tips from anyone would be greatly appreciated. How far back do they go? Will anyone hire an old sobered up drunk? I ran a detailed background check on myself nine years ago and everything showed up. 
       I got my first dwai at 19. I got caught with a little marijuana at 23. I got into a bar fight and arrested for misdemeanor assault at 38. Another DWI at 40. Got sober for three years. Messed that up and got a felony DWI ( second within 10 years) at 50. At the moment I am so thankful for never having killed or hurt anyone while drunken driving. By the grace of God and a wonderful wife I am still above ground today. 

     I have worked since I am sixteen years old and worked in the concrete business in Manhattan six years, then I was a doorman in a luxury building for six years while I went to college to become a teacher. 
Taught high school in the Bronx at the largest school in NYC for six years and then became a stay at home dad. ( sober) for six years. Returned to teaching in the Bronx (where I am from) for two years. The city closed the school and I was lucky enough to get hired in a private school where they must not have run a background check. I had a fantastic 9 years there till coronavirus shut the school down as the students came from other countries and can’t or don’t want to now. 

   I have been on unemployment since May. I have to work soon. Being home is difficult and I need more money for my family. My wife has been out of work for two years. I have been searching and seeking but can’t get anything. I realize perhaps 35-40 million people are out of work but I also realized that almost no one will hire someone with 3 dwi’s and an assault and a ganja possession violation, all of which still appears on a background check.

Probably started in my early 20s when I was drinking for days in a row, at least on the weekends. I eventually started to get hangovers that were so prolonged and drawn out, I sort of have to describe them in steps, almost like phases.

Phase 1: pretty much still drunk, this happens right after I wake up and lasts maybe until noonish or at least 3-4 hours after I wake up. The scary part about this phase is I still feel ""good"" and have driven multiple times like this, knowing I could get a dui. I mean I've driven 3 hours and worked a 12 hour shift doing this.

Phase 2: the actual hangover, this is where I get the hangxiety, feel achy, nauseous, headache, loss of balance/coordination, you know typical hangover stuff. All these symptoms and more will last up until the moment I go to bed that night.

Phase 3: day two, achy, my eyes feel sore (sleep quality has been horrendous for both days) and of course dehydration. My stomach feels constantly empty and I'm a little shaky with some muscle spasms.

Phase 4: basically the same as three but just much more mild and this can go onto a third day if I got drunk enough

Now, how much booze does it take to get like this? Not much at all really. Just recently in one night I had 3 IPAs at 8% and some sake at 19% (like 12 oz maybe). Which even consumed over the course of only a few hours, is quite moderate. I used to drink all day long until I blacked out, came to and then repeated. Even the thought of getting black out or drinking until I throw up scares me and I fear it may lead to long term affects. 

So to conclude this I'll list some positives and some negatives

Negatives: obviously my overall health, especially sleep and quality of sleep, I get horrible insomnia and will sleep maybe 3-4 during these extended hangovers. I lose some form of memory during intoxication, the hangover and after. I'll forget simple words, names and phases and lose my train of thought frequently. I mostly fear that drinking like this could eventually lead to some sort of mental illness.

Positives: I still have a great time with friends and find it to be a great social lubricant, and being fairly extroverted its usually worth it to tie a decent buzz on. I also am still able to function very well whilst hungover and coworkers have told me they didn't even notice, which is sort of a double edge sword if you think about it. I don't get that bad of anxiety or depression from hangovers anymore probably because I don't hate my life and I'm generally happy. If anything these shitty hangovers make it easier to abstain from alcohol, but I still have the propensity to binge drink.

Really i just wanted to make this post to see if anyone has similar experiences and how they dealt with them. I've basically given up on trying ""remedies"" as they really just make you feel only slightly better, i know the real answer is abstinence. I also admit that I may not seem like much of an alcoholic but when I was in the military I had a much bigger issue with not only alcohol but also drug use.

I realize this is sort of a lengthy post so pardon me for yammering away lol but I feel like this is the most efficient way to get some insight. I don't think I need help necessarily but would love to hear some other stories and everyone's thoughts and of course start some discussion.",2020-09-26 17:52:26

Will my drinking turn into a problem?,9,izszrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/izszrd/will_my_drinking_turn_into_a_problem/,19,1601099881.0,"To start off, I’m 19, F and I’ve been drinking since around 13-14. However back then it would always just be a beer once in a blue moon or something at family parties. 

Recently, as in this last year I’ve noticed I’ve been drinking every weekend and every time I’m stressed. I live with my boyfriend and we go/do almost everything together so on weekends while he likes to get high-since drinking really isn’t his thing except every now and then, I buy a daiquiri filled with 3-5 shots. If we’re at a party I drink beer after beer, or down bottles until I nearly black out. I don’t know why, but I can never just have one. Not one shot, not one beer. 

Also, any time we get into a big argument I tend to go buy a daiquiri loaded with shots just so I can sleep worry free. Any time I’m in a big social setting, which is rare, I want a few drinks to make it easier to talk to people. 

At first I was having fun, but now I’m worried about if this seems like it could go down the wrong path? I would love to stop turning to alcohol any time I’m stressed or want to have fun. It’s not like I crave it when I’m just home for the evening, but nearly every weekend I end up blacked out because I couldn’t have just one or because I was stressed and I need help.",2020-09-26 01:58:01
What to do when you only abuse alcohol in infrequent social situations,3,iwskg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iwskg6/what_to_do_when_you_only_abuse_alcohol_in/,9,1600687303.0,"I’m considering going sober. And I need your help.

I only really drink in social situations. I rarely drink weeknights and never on my own. I also could go weeks and not think about alcohol or be tempted to drink it. For me it’s a social thing, at events or for dinner or a gathering. 

Here’s the problem. Because I don’t drink that much that often, it doesn’t take much for me to get a buzz. Sometimes I drink to the point of blacking out and I wake up the next day forgetting half the night. It happened nearly every weekend in college, and multiple times a month in university.

I’m a married 27 year old (F) and since graduating (2016) it’s happened far less. But it’s still happening. Now it happens 1-3 times per year.

I think part of why I drink too much is due to social anxiety and wanting to fit in and keep up with everyone else. Sometimes I drink with people that are heavy drinkers / partiers that are likely not a good influence, encouraging me to take shots or keep up. But I also get blackout drunk with some of my closet friends. It seems to all link back to comfort in a way and wanting to fit in. 

I have had some non-clinical anxiety and depression since I was a teenager and definitely had a challenging childhood, self esteem issues etc. Have had moderation issues with food in addition to alcohol. Father was an alcoholic and abused drugs from a young age. I visit a counsellor multiple times a year, meditate often but not daily, workout and try to maintain balance in most of my life otherwise. But I’ve never sought help for alcoholism in particular, although it’s come up. 

The biggest reason I am considering going sober is for my marriage. I’ve said some terrible things to my husband over the years when I’ve been blackout drunk and have gotten myself into bad situations. We have been together 10 years (high school sweethearts) and he is the most forgiving person I know. He has seen me blackout so many times and my mood is always so unpredictable in those moments. He sees that I’m trying and refuses to give up on me. And I don’t want to give up on myself, I know I can get past this but I need help. 

Part of why it’s hard is that I truly enjoy social drinking when I don’t take it too far. I love supporting local craft breweries and my husband and I bond over sharing flights so much. 

TLDR; Can someone that only abuses alcohol in social situations learn moderation and control their drinking? Or is it best to go sober and avoid the possibility of taking it too far altogether?

Thanks!",2020-09-21 07:21:43
How concerned should I be about this habit?,5,iz40la,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iz40la/how_concerned_should_i_be_about_this_habit/,4,1601004642.0,"I honestly don't know why I'm making this post, but I feel the need to vent to people that might be able to understand what I'm going through. I have severe social anxiety and the only way I feel comfortable hanging out with my friends is to drink. They are all heavy drinking alcoholics so hanging out there sober is incredibly difficult if not impossible. A friend in our group actually had to move recently to a different state because he's up there in age and is starting to have health problems. He couldn't stop hanging out with us/stop drinking so he moved near his sister across the country.

I've gotten to the point where I limit myself to 1 pint of nasty cheap gin in a night, but I'm drinking far too often. I am disabled so I don't work. Other than volunteering at the free kitchen downtown once or twice a week, I have nothing but time on my hands. That means I'm getting drunk about once every 3 days. That's the part that is concerning me. If I was doing this once a week, I wouldn't think much of it.

I'm getting better at staying out of trouble when I'm drunk though so I guess that's a good thing. It's not like I'm still going out to the bar, driving, getting in fights, and putting myself in dangerous situations (I haven't driven drunk or buzzed in about 12 years). We mostly just sit around, listen to music, and play chess. If I were to give up alcohol, that would almost certainly mean I'd have to stop hanging out with my friends.

How bad is this? I don't really have a life for this behavior to affect, past the health aspect. Like I said, we're just listening to music and playing chess (staying out of trouble). How concerned should I be about this behavior? Don't worry about judgement, I have thick skin.",2020-09-24 23:30:42

I think my friend is an alcoholic or at least starting to become one? I don't know how to help her because we are both young - we are both 18 (18 is the legal age for purchasing alcohol where we live). 

I've noticed that my friend spends heaps of money on alcohol and drinks at least every evening to the point of getting drunk and makes lots of bad decisions while intoxicated,  she has also smuggled alcohol into school to drink on multiple occasions. It's just weird because my friend doesn't even like socially drinking or partying, she just stays at home and drinks on her own. Recently I tried to get her to open up to me about why she feels the need to drink so often and she admitted it's due to stress of school and family life, I've also tried to get her to understand my concerns about her using alcohol as a coping mechanism and that it's becoming an issue but I'm constantly met with her saying things like 'its fine, I can stop whenever I want to, it's just that I don't want to'. It's becoming a major concern to me because I don't want anything bad to happen to her or for it to become even worse of an issue. Like mentioned, I just need some advice and direction. I don't know who to talk to about this or even what to do.

I was prescribed benzos for tense situations but ended up abusing that too. Even though I have lost a lot because of alcohol (girlfriend, 2 jobs, started having convulsions), I just don't consider myself an alcoholic. I guess that for me to accept this, my life would have to be absolutely destroyed, like some people I met on AA (which didn't work for me), and some stories on here.
This has led me to have constant relapses, one of which was a 4 day binge streak.

We bonded over some shared life circumstances which we helped each other through and well, one thing led to another, and despite us both being married and on other sides of the world from each other, we have recently professed our love for each other. All good so far right ..

Well my worry is that over the last few weeks she confessed to having a serious drinking problem, so bad in fact that she’s lost control of it, she’s just lost her job and lousy dead marriage ( co-dependency I think) because of it. She's checked herself into a rehab program a couple of days after we exchanged those magical loaded 3 words to each other. She’s promised to get better to me (not for me - which I don’t think would be healthy)

Now I HAVE to do the right thing by her, as her health and life is much more important to me than my own happiness or any relationship we might or might not have in the future. Before she went in, I told her that if during rehab she decides that our online relationship is not healthy or good for her, then I’m OK with that, she comes first. ( she replied OK) . I have been reading about the treatments and behavioural therapy etc. that goes on, and I'm thinking she may come out of the program a completely different person ?

I’m considering leaving my marriage for this girl, if things continue to work out between us ( trip being planned to meet asap after Covid) , but her alcoholism has me worried for our future and her recovery.

Surely starting\\continuing a newish relationship must be a huge risk factor for a recovering alcoholic fresh out of rehab ? To say im nervous, waiting to see how we are together when she comes out is a massive understatement !

Last night was one of them.

I have tried posting this for a while now. So here it goes. Ever since I have been somewhat of an adult (I'm 29 atm) I have had problems with alcohol. I can remember when I was in high school, I used to shot 4-5 glasses of scotch to fall asleep. Since then I graduated college, got a first job in a competive industry, bought a house, got married. 

Fast forward to today, drinking heavily and abusing alcohol has been persistent while not always as bad. It comes in waves it seems. Right now I feel like I am slipping to the point of no return. While working from home during the COVID-19 situation, I wake up with scotch and a finish half of a bottle of wine before lunch and I can't seem to quit it.

Am I a happier person? I am not. But the pain I experience is at least different. I am still lethargic and depressed. It is more inward as I am way less social when sober. So I am lonely and stuck in a box, as opposed to lonely but drunkenly reaching out.

For this reasons I hate alcohol and drinking but on the other hand I like the effect it produces on me when I take the right amount of it.

I don’t know if i should just stop drinking or learn how to drink properly so I don’t get sooo drunk. I kinda feel like I will be missing a lot and not have the same amount of fun if I become abstemious since as an introverted I would feel pretty bored if it wasn’t for the alcohol.

I made a new account because I’m really uncomfortable talking about this. For the last year or so I’ve been wondering if I have an issue with alcohol. I keep thinking “everyone has it so much worse, you’re just overthinking it”. Mostly because I don’t drink a six pack a day, but whatever. 

Anyway, figured it can’t hurt to ask y’all what you think since this seems like a pretty supportive space. 

Reasons I think I have a problem:
 - I always told myself “I don’t have a problem because I only drink socially”, but more recently I’ve started with “just a glass of wine” when I’m alone too. 
 - It’s my go-to drink after work because “I just enjoy it”
 - When I drink, I have 2-4 drinks at a time. Which is probably 2-3 times a week. For a petite woman, that feels like a lot. But when I’m drinking it doesn’t?? It’s weird.

Coming to the realization that alcohol abuse was good for my depression,2,iu96zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iu96zz/coming_to_the_realization_that_alcohol_abuse_was/,7,1600333834.0,"So recently I decided to take a break from alcohol after probably drinking almost every day since I turned 21. I truly almost never drank before then, then kept it around a reasonable pace. However, it quickly turned into chasing the buzz and going to bed tipsy or slightly drunk, every single night (I’m now almost 24). I’ve become increasingly concerned that this is quickly evolving into high functioning alcoholism (as I almost never drink before 5 unless with friends & my life is mostly in order) & due to the mounting cost I decided to take a break. 

To connect this to depression, I was fairly depressed before college. Things got a little better but until I turned 21 they still weren’t great. A couple months into 21 and I felt like my quality of life increased dramatically. I chalked this up to having a much better dating and social life, as well as getting into a masters program I really enjoyed. 

However, during the past weekish I’ve been off alcohol I’ve found myself slipping back into depression. Less vigor for life, being tired (I know this could be withdrawal symptoms), and in general feeling kind of mundane. Maybe this is just a temporary effect, but I feel like in many ways that nightly buzz made me more excited every day, as I had something to look forward to, a complete disconnect. In many ways it signaled the end of a day of work for me, an immediate way to disconnect and eventually drift into a more blissful state. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences? The only things I’ve read is that alcohol makes depression worse, which is the opposite of my issue. 

TL;DR: The anticipation for unwinding every night with a few (to more than a few) drinks may have cured my depression, & now that I’m off alcohol I feel far more down",2020-09-17 05:10:34

He made that decision while drunk, and family was refusing to give him more. He overdosed on medication. He went into cardiac arrest multiple times, had severe grad mal seizures, and required intubation and later a tracheostomy. Developed bloodclots, cdiff; pneumonia and brachial nerve injury. Was comotose for the entire time and we were being asked to consider a DNR and palliative care. No one thought he would be functional if he woke up, do to the big possibility of anoxic brain damage. Well against ALL odds he woke up. He woke up agitated at first but he woke up and regain all motor function and cognitive awareness. 
Now he can walk, talk, feed himself, and actually a week ago we went on a 6 mile hike up the mountains! This was something no one, thought would ever happen. A miracle by any extent of the word. 
 

Yet he continues to drink. when he was medically stable they put him in a psychiatric unit for observation. there he was drinking hand sanitizer behind the nursing staff's back. Once he got home after being hospitalised for almost 2 months, he went and got himself some liquor. So my question is- someone who has been severely addicted,  what finally made u decide enough is enough and u want to change ??",2020-09-14 22:01:04
Fewest Words to Inspire,2,isecnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/isecnv/fewest_words_to_inspire/,4,1600088041.0,"First real post. Inspire me. 

I grew up with an alcoholic father. My mother packed up and left him when I was 2. Supported 3 boys on a teacher salary. She is a saint.  My childhood was fantastic, and I owe that all to her. 

I am now 32 years old. I have a beautiful 4 year old daughter. She is incredible. 

My wife (together 11 years, married 4) is a recovering addict (sober 6 years!). Staying together over that time was rough, but I stayed with it - she did all the real work 100%. She is amazing, and I am so proud to share my life with her. . 

My ask. I need some inspiration to change my course. I like to drink. I have no legal issues, no DUIs, and I do not arrive to work late (remote during COVID - idle time is not great for this), and I am not an angry/abusive drunk. But I drink multiple (4-6-8...) drinks a day, usually afternoon. Over past 2 years I have gained ~30lbs (I come from a genetically freaky athletic family and I am no exception). I don’t feel like the best me. 

I am terrified to end up like my dad. I adore my daughter and am scared shitless to be a deadbeat dad (my father is a wonderful part of life now, but he still struggles). Inspire me...",2020-09-14 08:54:01

I just moved across country and I've been out of work for the last two months because of both covid and anxiety. 
On days that I don't drink, I find myself craving any kind of alcohol. If there's any in the house, I usually blow through it in a few days. At this point, it's not really affecting my life but I can tell that my partner is uncomfortable with it (he only occasionally drinks).

Ok well I'll drink on weekdays but I'll set a limit and stick to it. I over did it again (shocker). I then agreed to take another month off because it would be easy.. I've done it before? Failed. 

I am no longer in denial. I am an alcoholic. I committed to no drinking for the rest ot 2020 and am doing good so far. No alcohol for 2020 is a hard goal but I know its achievable. I know drinking again in 2021 will send me on another downward spiral but I felt a solid date was less intimidating than ""never again."" I felt like after these 4 months I'd be able to drink occasionally at a special event or something but I now realize that those are just the demons in my head trying to convince me to slip.

How do I avoid drinking? I feel extremely socially awkward and bored when I’m not drinking or I feel the need to do other drugs in place of it. Also, none of my friends seem to be sober so it’s hard, and I want to meet people at bars since it’s free(idk where else) so it’s be weird.

During quarantine I was absolutely miserable, we would fight every other day, my boyfriend loves to be social everything kind of shut out bc of quaratine. he was working from home, he couldn’t go to any bars with his friends, he always at his house drinking


Months into quarantine, he shared that’s once he started living alone he would drink a 12 pack or more a night and he starting to grow to hate his job even more and more, he also said that he was so hung over once that he threw up blood, and I heard that was a huge sign that someone was on the way to becoming alcoholic (April)

he “cut back” drinking ever since that happened but he still drank consistently and tonight he was really angry about his job and there wasn’t really anything I could do to make him feel better, he’s looking for liquor stores that were open and they were all closed and he said he would shoot himself if he didn’t get any alcohol, He found one that was open and literally sped there to get some beer, right after we came back and he drank some alcohol he was completely better

I know that sometimes people have hard days but my concern has grown more, and to add to all of this, his dad is an alcoholic

I just don’t know what to do, I feel like whenever he drinks we fight more and he couldn’t handle a night without it because of his anger, I feel like that shows some dependency

In the beginning of a relationship I didn’t think it was my place to say anything but it turned out to be true because he threw up blood, should I follow a premonition and say something to him? Is it my place? Everyone around him drinks, so it seems like he’s fine, but I’ve been around a lot of people and no one I know drinks like him",2020-09-08 06:52:26
I've finally taken step one! (/advice on quitting / with withdrawal?),6,io8rxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/io8rxf/ive_finally_taken_step_one_advice_on_quitting/,1,1599519023.0,"I decided just saying I'm going to try isn't enough, and since yesterday I've quit. My target is not drinking for at least the next few months, and if I ever start again, it'll be strictly social. But in all honesty I think I may just be telling myself it's not permanent to make the first few days or weeks a bit easier on the mental side of it.

I used to drink at home just for the feeling. Life felt more fun with alcohol, and because I used to be alone I didn't see any problems. But since then, I've come to realise alcohol affects those around me so much more than me, and if I can't do it for myself I need to do it for them, and although I can lie to myself I can't bring myself to lie to them. 

I used to drink between 4.5 and 9 units basically every day, and on benders I'd drink 15+ units in one night, that was usually about once every two or three weeks. Rinse and repeat from about March this year until now (thanks quarantine, taking everything and leaving nothing but video games and alcohol). I didn't think I was a heavy drinker until I looked at the numbers. Plus the sheer prospect of how much money I'll save from quitting is like a bribe to myself lol.

Now it's been about 40 hours since my last drink and I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I never considered them for some reason, I guess I thought I didn't drink enough (dumbass I was). I've got the anxiety, headaches, increased heart rate, I think insomnia is coming on (but idk because I did sleep for a few hours in the day). I don't think they're severe, but I need to ask: should I seek help in quitting? I really don't want to think I need it, it's only been a few months and the symptoms right now don't seem extreme, although the anxiety did make me take a mental health day from work, but I don't want to play the brave face and end up accidentally endangering myself or others. If it matters, I'm 20 (legal in my country, so I don't have to worry about the legality of seeking help if it's necessary).

Sorry if it's a bit of a ramble, I'm finding it hard to concentrate. Please let me know if you have any advice!",2020-09-07 18:50:23
I fucked up last night,45,in35ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/in35ql/i_fucked_up_last_night/,50,1599349011.0,"I went to a social distancing party last night and got black out drunk. I mean, I was already wasted when I showed up and then proceeded to drink all the drinks. I was a hot mess and ran my mouth off to a near and dear friend. He reacted very angrily. Literally yelling in my face. I started crying, apologizing over and over. Repeating myself like a drunken fool. My fiancé pulled me out of the party and drove me home. He yelled at me the entire way home. Both men are really reasonable, kind people. I must have said something unbelievably bad for both of them to react that way. I don’t even know what I said...

I’m so incredibly embarrassed this morning. I’m hungover as hell and the shakes are already starting. I’m so mad at myself. I was doing so good with my drinking and now here I am sitting in my car, trying to decide if I should force myself to be productive or go find mimosas somewhere.

Why do I do this? I don’t get it. I know alcoholism and addiction are diseases but I can’t help but feel I’m choosing this. I chose to pick up the bottle last night. I chose to continue drinking. I’m making a choice now of what my day is going to look like. I keep thinking it’s going to get better and I keep choosing bad decisions. I don’t know why I’m posting this. I don’t know if I need support, harsh words, to be told it’s going to be ok... I just know I need help. I can’t do this anymore

I have resorted to cutting myself off from everyone left in my life in order to avoid bothering them, however this has left me feeling so utterly alone and depressed all I can think about when I'm awake is how badly I wish I was dead. I feel overwhelmed with regret for my past mistakes, with no solution in sight. Even if I'm sober now , it doesn't change the past and it doesn't make me easier to be around.

I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't have any willpower to do anything I once enjoyed. I don't see the reward of being clean, when it's done nothing but push people farther from me.

The purpose of this post is for me to put my concerns out there, put “thoughts to paper” per se and I would greatly appreciate any input.",6,ip4fjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ip4fjo/i_think_i_am_a_problem_drinker_and_have_realized/,18,1599635594.0,"I am a male in my mid 30’s, married with a kid and have a great family, good job and an amazing home - I am fully aware that I have a life that many others could only dream about. But I believe that I have put it in jeopardy a large number of occurences because of alcohol. And the times that I didn’t actually put it in jeopardy, I have behaved in ways that has brought embarrassment and pain to myself and my family. This has been going on for almost the past 20 years.

I have done a lot of reading on this topic - I do not believe I am an alcoholic based on the definitions and descriptions that I have read of the word alocholic. I am not dependent on alcohol. I do not crave beer, wine or liquor in the slightest when I am going about my normal routine. I can go many days and weeks without drinking and not even think twice about it. Leftover beers and bottles of liquor/wine will sit in my fridge and cabinets for weeks and months until the next get together and I don’t even look twice at them. However, my social life and circles are important to me and I do enjoy get togethers with my friends either going to the bar and having beers or having a barbecue at my house or someone else’s house and having drinks there. The problem is that too many times when I am having a good time at a bar or party, I consume to excess. I literally just keep drinking beer after beer after beer.. and end up getting intoxicated. There have been times that I have taken shots of liquor and glasses of wine as well in addition to the multiple beers and would become very intoxicated. While I’m doing it, I am having the time of my life but there have been times when it would cause me to make a fool of myself by doing things like falling down stairs and getting into fights with my wife. The next day I would wake up feeling incredibly guilty and hungover.

But an even bigger concern to me (since it involves public safety) is when I have gotten behind the wheel of my car. I cannot count how many times I have gotten behind the wheel of my car while intoxicated and then woke up the next morning thinking, “I should not have driven.” I have rear ended a parked car because I was intoxicated and not paying attention. Thankfully, the car I hit was a beater that already had dents and damage all over it - when I returned the next morning to the house where the car was parked in front of, the car was gone and the occupants of the house said they had no idea what I was talking about. In the following days, I saw the car in the neighborhood multiple times and after keeping an eye on it for a while and finally speaking with the operator of it, I came to the conclusion that they possibly were illegal immigrants and the car wasn’t insured and they didn’t want to get involved with anything so I just let it go. I have been pulled over and given a field sobriety test that I passed but just barely according to the cop. While he was giving me the test, another car driving by crashed into a stop sign knocking it over and drove off causing most of the cops on scene where I was to jump in their cars and take off after them. I had a few more similar close call incidents like this throughout my adult life. I have said to myself multiple times, “I got away with it… I can’t keep doing this… I need to stop getting so drunk and getting behind the wheel.” The last time I did it was one of the past weekends… I drank multiple high ABV craft beers with my friends at a bar before driving home and I recall almost missing my exit on the expressway and speeding up to merge and last minute looking at my blind spot and seeing a car in there that I was about to hit so I swerved back into my lane. This is when I said, “THAT’S IT…. NO MORE” and is what led me to typing all of this out.

I HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT WAY TOO MANY TIMES. Maybe there is a limit on the number of times I can get away with it before something happens that destroys my life and my family.

I did some research and discovered a practice called “mindful drinking” which in hindsight is pretty much common sense. It is the practice of being consciously aware of how much you are drinking and having a plan.. something I don’t think I have practiced in decades. I put it to practice at a barbecue not long after that incident and was able to go through the whole party drinking 2 light beers and 1 IPA over the span of approximately 7 hours leaving me feeling fine afterwards. So maybe the solution to my problem is that I need to practice self control and discipline and use the power of my mind to ensure that I do not get so intoxicated leading to poor decisions. Regardless, I do not want to continue putting my life or someone else’s in jeopardy… which is why I am here.

Any input, criticism or ideas would be greatly appreciated.. especially if you have been or are currently are in the same situation.",2020-09-09 03:13:14
I don't know how to best help my high functioning alcoholic wife and set boundaries for my own sanity and anxiety. Any help or thoughts are appreciated.,4,ik2i1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ik2i1n/i_dont_know_how_to_best_help_my_high_functioning/,5,1598924039.0,"My wife has a problem with alcohol. She has been a pretty heavy drinker for as long as I have known her. She is high functioning, but she is slowly killing herself and I don't know how to help her and at the same time set boundaries for myself. Apologies in advance for a long post; I'm freaking out a bit, and I have no one to talk to.

When I say High functioning, I mean that she is able to do her job well, take care of the kids and keep them happy, and keep a pretty damn clean house. When she drinks more heavily, she does sometimes tend toward a Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde thing where sometimes she can either get super lovey and sexual (she knows sex my weakness as I'm high libido) or she can get a bit aggressive and confrontational. Just depends on the day I guess and what excuse she happened to use to drink that day.

I feel like I should note that she was pretty regularly drinking 2-3 bottles of wine per day and has recently been having a couple of times where she has gone as many as 8 days without drinking anything. I do think she is trying at least somewhat, but she is fighting an uphill battle. I feel like she needs help, but she insists that I'm being dramatic and that because she is no longer drinking 2-3 bottles per day every day, that I should be happy that she is getting better. I am happy that she is trying to get better, but I am afraid we have reached a point where she has stalled and is not getting any better. She is a member of One Year No Beer, and she keeps telling me how those people say they have tried 80+ times and keep failing before something ""clicks"" and I fear that is being used as an excuse for her to keep kicking the can down the road and not really doing anything about it. She insists that she just isn't getting better ""fast enough"" for me, and that I have to just give her time. How much time am I seriously supposed to give her? The anxiety I'm having over her drinking is slowly killing me also. Some days I feel like my blood pressure is through the roof and that my head is going to explode from the stress this is causing me. I've told her this, and it doesn't seem to affect her decisions. She blames it on not getting any alone time, and I'm like ""NOBODY IS GETTING ALONE TIME!"" Except of course of the alone time she gets when I'm putting the girls to bed and when I go downstairs afterwards so she can watch TV until she goes to bed. I suppose that doesn't count.

I'm trying to work on setting some boundaries that are healthy for me to set, but I'm finding that with COVID-19 being a thing, it can be hard to enforce them. I don't want to be around her when she drinks. I don't like the uncertainty of knowing which wife I'm going to get on that day. It isn't fair for me to have to deal with that anxiety so that she can get drunk. So my preference is to separate myself from her when she makes that choice. The only problem is that she then uses the girls as a weapon to try to force me to be around them. If I try to go downstairs to separate myself, I get accused of abandoning the kids, which isn't what is happening. She has offered to go upstairs and shut herself in the bedroom so that I don't have to be around her, but it isn't fucking fair for me to then have to deal with the kids by myself for the rest of the night because she chose to drink. So I don't know what to do. I don't know how to enforce that boundary without being accused of ""abandoning the kids"" or having to be fully responsible for the entire day. It is worth mentioning that even if I leave her with them for a bit, I still have a bedtime routine that I do with them every single night which involves giving them a bath on bath night, getting their teeth brushed and pajamas on, reading them a couple of books, singing them several songs, and then snuggling with them until they fall asleep or are at least really sleepy.

I'm also pissed off about the amount of money she is spending on wine. She is buying $13-15 bottles of wine every time and chugging them down in a day. This shit is adding up to hundreds if not thousands of money pissed down the drain so that she doesn't have to cope with her problems in a healthy way. I told her today that we are reaching a point of having to take her credit cards and leaving her with only her debit card to buy wine. She got really mad at me and said that we were nowhere near that point because she has ""gotten so much better"" than she was when she was drinking 2-3 bottles a day. She HAS gotten better, but she's still got a problem, and it is still affecting her family.

I'm also tired of the manipulations. She knows I have an extremely high libido and that it is almost impossible for me to say not to sex. She has a pretty low libido, so I consider any sex that happens to be a gift. She knows this, so she comes home with a bottle of wine, and before she cracks it open, she takes me upstairs to have sex because she feels it will soften me up to the idea of her drinking. I've reached the point where even after sex, I'm still not acting like I'm ok with the drinking, and of course since that has happened, the sex has dropped off. So, of course, I'm not only dealing with less sex, but I'm also dealing with knowing that all the sex that was happening was just a manipulation.

So, I've said all of that to say that I'm working hard on figuring out how to stop enabling her. I'm new to standing my ground like this, so I'm terrible at it. Her friend, who also has a drinking problem, came over here this past weekend to help her paint our living room, and like an idiot, I went to buy them beer because I didn't want to embarrass her in front of her friend by pointing out that she didn't need beer.

Her birthday is coming up soon. We are planning to have some friends over who have been isolating like we are so that our kids can have someone to play with for a bit, and we can have some adult interaction. All of these friends drink a decent amount and some have a tendency to drink to the point of making bad decisions. She has already said that she doesn't know if she is going to drink or not on her birthday. I've got to be honest with you, I don't want to be here if she does. I want to leave. I really want to tell her in advance that she needs to let me know in advance if she is going to drink so I can plan to not be here and that if she doesn't tell me and drinks anyway that I will be leaving. I don't know where the hell I will go, but I haven't thought that far ahead.

Obviously, I've got a lot of shit going on with this. My anxiety is through the roof. I've broken down crying several times and told her how afraid I was of losing my wife to this disease. I love her dearly, I really do. She is my person, and she has helped me through some really tough times. I just can't deal with this fear anymore. This is all made worse by the fact that I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I've tried my local alanon group, and I really hated it. I'm an atheist, and I'm in a part of the country that is super religious, so although they claim your higher power can be anything you want it to be, we all had to hold hands and someone said a prayer that was definitely 100% a Judaeo Christian prayer before they said the little invocation thing that they say.

Due to covid, i had to move back in with my parents and it’s just gotten so much worse. i drink every night and don’t care about my consequences. i’m still able to go to work and function like a normal person generally but behind the scenes i’m blacking out almost every night. i storm out of my boyfriends apartment once a week when i get drunk and just drive (yes, drive while intoxicated- something i would never have done before) to my parents and then he doesn’t doesn’t care and just asks me to come back the next day. it’s so hard to think about not being able to drink at all anymore but i hate who i become whenever i pass that line of being “fun” and go into being “crazy”. i don’t think i can consider myself being an alcoholic because it doesn’t effect my work life. 

A side note is that I’m on a few medications which i think tend to send me over the edge when i drink but i’m not sure how to dial all of it back without ditching alcohol completely. any advice?",2020-09-02 19:46:15

What Helped Me Finally Break Away,16,innov3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/innov3/what_helped_me_finally_break_away/,6,1599434117.0,"Hey all, I have something I’d really like any of you who are struggling with alcoholism to look into.  It helped me in a way nothing else has, and I hope you’ll listen, because this has helped me go from rock bottom to where I am now. 

First, my background: I started drinking on weekends in my 20’s and around 2014 it began to happen daily.  My early 2016 I realized I was in a vicious cycle where I was either drunk or hungover, and eventually it reached the point that my eyes turned yellow.  I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with acute alcoholic hepatitis.  A healthy leaves of bilirubin is 1-2.  Mine was 17.  I detoxed and was sent home vowing to never drink again.  Cut to two and a half years later, when I really felt I had it under control, not having drank in 31 months, when I decided I could drink in moderation.  It didn’t work and almost overnight I spiraled straight back into that cycle, only worse.  I made a point not to drink on the clock (I work from home because of Covid) but was basically drunk every other minute of the day.  I kept trying and trying to stop and I’d make it about a day and start again.  The rational part of me knew I had to stop or I would die, but it felt like there something in my head that I called “The Parasite” that felt like it had hijacked my brain and made me drink.  My anxiety went through the roof (which was basically alcohol withdrawal), my depression got worse, and finally I started having suicidal thoughts.  I felt like I was trapped in a nightmare that I couldn’t escape.

Reading r/alcoholism, someone recommended a book called This Naked Mind by Annie Grace, and I ordered it off Amazon.  The book is about how to break free so that not only do you stay sober, you don’t even want to drink.  The main things the book focuses on are:

1.  Your brain has a conscious and subconscious side.  When you struggle with alcoholism your conscious brain is telling you that you need to stop and your subconscious, which has been programmed for years by everything from the addictive qualities of alcohol to how society has normalized it, is telling you drink.  The goal is to reprogram your subconscious so it views alcohol not as what you need, but as a poison that shouldn’t be in your life.
2.   Alcohol is an addictive drug and anyone, no matter who they are, can become addicted.  It is not a character flaw.  Everyone who drinks is on the same downward slope, it’s just that some people are further down it than others, and a few people are able to hold onto the side of the slope, but the more you drink the more your tolerance builds and the further down you slide.  The author brings up an example: she was on the Vegas strip once and saw a homeless man begging for money holding a bottle of cheap liquor in a paper bag and saw a few drunk guys on their 20’s holding their yard-long drinks give him money, laughing and having fun and seeing him as “other people” and something that would never happen to them, unaware they were on the same downward slope, just further up it than the homeless drunk.
3.  Normal methods of staying sober like AA leave the person in a mindset where all they think about it being sober, and it’s a miserable life spending your entire life focusing every day on fighting cravings.  There is so much to focus on in life that is wonderful, and if you spend your whole life focusing on staying sober, always thinking about it, that’s not a way to live.  
4.  The goal is to make it so you don’t spend every day saying “I can’t drink” but instead “I don’t want to drink.”

I read the entire book in one night, and I it changed my entire mindset.  The author also has an online website and a YouTube channel where she answers questions about alcoholism and sobriety.  If you are struggling with alcohol and feel like you are trapped, please please please order this book.  It changed everything about how I handle staying sober

(and English is not my first language, so sorry for my grammar).
I am only 16 years old and I drink a lot. Mostly everyday. I started drinking when I was 13 (I know, pretty young). I used to drink every weekend but when I turned 16 I kinda started to loose control. I started to drink day by day, and I started to loose track of time too. I now can't remember a thing about what happened when, and I started to drink very often. I mean about 20 and more days in a row, and I can hardly remember 10 of them fully. Today I decided to stop. I mean, my idea isn't to stop drinking but to spot getting drunk like a pig. I want to go on a party on weekend and drink like 2-3 beers, and not to get full drunk. Should I cut off drinking in full, or keep my ideal 2-3 beers?
I know I sound silly for most of people, but believe me I don't remember most of this year because of alcohol, and I feel to young to ruin my life because of alcohol.

i will really apreciette advice in this case. Im 26 male and last 2-3 years i started to drink a lot at home, like 3-4x times a week usually + 1-2x a week social drinking on average. I always knew it is not good and healty, but was always sure i can quit whenever i can.   
Last 40 days i dont think i had day without a drink. I didnt get really drunk on any day, like 3-4 beers on average ( the most like 8, sometimes only 2). But i started to feel that my brain NEEDS alcohol. In the evening i start to feel depressed/anxious, so i get a beer to feel better.  


I ve decided i want to really cut off a lot my drinking and want to go at least week without drinking. Is it safe in my case to go cold turkey? I ve read a lot about alcohol withdrawal and im afraid to get shakes in work (im working with clients a lot) or seizure that can danger my healt.

I don't want to totally blame the virus for it, nor want to bore people that are already reading with the details. But I lost a good part of my life because of quarentine, most specially my job, which I loved. And had to go back to living with my mother.  
Depression hit hard, something that probably was coming for a long time now, but apparently all that happened was the last drop for it to effect me, and it did. It did hard enough that I returned to drinking, and god I can't stop. My mother was starting to suspect it, and I knew if she discovered she and my stepfather wouldn't let me drink anymore, I felt desperated. The only times I felt alive again was when I was drunk to the point of not remembering anything the other day.   
I had to maintain that feeling, so I started using rubbing alcohol. Not pure, obviously. I mixed it with juice and/or water. It felt terrible, the hangovers were 100x worst, everytime I woke up I felt dead, but in my head it was the only answer to stop my parents from discovering and to maintain my getting drunk routine. Just today, as I was about to drink again, I saw how I was just throwing my life away, again. And that I needed help. I'm too ashamed to ask for help irl, so that's the reason i'm here.

He used to have a drinking problem but he managed to stay sober for a few years, and recent events has caused him drink again.

He repeatedly tells me he feels horrible about it and wants to stop, and i believe he truly does - he just lacks the will. He seems to be struggling to set his mind straight to go cold turkey and it is really affecting me as well. Everyday i struggle to stay hopeful and i feel like I'm running out of ways to encourage and support him in this journey towards sobriety. I feel sad and disappointed every time he drinks, and i keep these feelings from him because i don't want him to feel worse about himself. 

The distance between us makes this harder because i cannot be with him and help him deal with his negative thoughts. When a person is left alone with his negative thoughts, the likelihood of engaging in self destructive behaviour is higher. It's just easier to take the easy way out, than to try and change things...

I know that only he can truly convince himself to stop drinking, and i want him to do so for himself, not for me.

The first year and a half was very rocky as he was drinking to the point of blacking out 4/5 times a week, and just not being a good person. 3 months ago I told him it was over due to his alcohol problem after him and I had multiple conversations, tried different help resources, you name it. He left the house for a month to clean himself up and get some help, which he did. Turns out he apparently had a moderation issue and needed to retrain himself to find an appropriate limit. He came back into the house and all seemed fine, we even tried him drinking a beer here and there, but slowly it has started to get worse. He’s now having drinks without telling me (his moderator) even if there are other people around, or once I asked him to slow down at a social event he did not. At this point I am not talking to him about his drinking every other week/once a week again. This last weekend he went to a company BBQ and asked me if he could have some beers there, I said yes but I would like to keep it around 3/4 at most. I found out the next day that he had 8 beers and drove home after being there for 4 hours. Then, this Sunday (his Saturday) he was having some beer during a hockey game, I checked on him before going to bed and he had about 5 cans beside him. He told me he was going to watch a couple episodes of his show and come to bed after. I woke up at 3AM to find he was not in bed. I did find him passed out in the spare bed (and sparing specific details) it was VERY obvious that he had drank way too much by himself and staggered the spare room as some point. 

I know this is supposed to be a learning curve but I am at my wits end. I told him today that I am giving him my months notice and that I cannot do this anymore. I cannot babysit him anymore and even when I ask him not to do something, hes not even listening to me. He tells me he’s okay and in control and then constantly does stuff like this. He doesn’t understand why im being so rash. 

My question to you is- am I being irrational for telling him that I’m done? 

This is my first time in a situation or relationship like this. I feel so exhausted and worn down. I have a small child to worry about (not from this relationship) as well, and I feel like this is no longer a good environment for either.

I just don't know if I can do this without constant supervision.

The fact I have her helps me incredibly, I would have been too scared otherwise. The weird thing is when I finally fall asleep, I sleep great and fine.

My step-brother is an alcoholic. So is his father. Here's the thing, he is very much functional. He is very successful professionally. By all outward accounts, he doesn't have a problem, but he does. He probably has about 10 drinks a day. It's hard to say, because he hides it most of the time, or at least tries to. He doesn't drink at all during the work day, but the minute he gets out of work, he drinks. Like in his car on the way home. He thinks no one knows about that, but they do. When he's confronted about it, he lies. He does drink during the day on weekends. I would not be surprised if he sneaked a drink or two during the work day. He uses his financial and professional success as proof that he doesn't have a problem.

He will go ""use the restroom"" during my nephew's soccer games on weekends, and you can smell the Scotch. He's not drunk, but he's obviously sneaking a flask in and taking sips and thinks no one can notice. I'm sure his kids have noticed but don't say anything. Even if they did say something, he wouldn't actually stop drinking at these events, he would just switch to something you can't smell. In other words, his first thought is not, ""I should really stop,"" but rather is, ""I really need to hide this better.""

He and my SIL have joint accounts for everything. He puts back 2 bottles of Scotch (like the big ones) a week that she knows of, but she noticed that no money was coming out of their account for them anymore. So she asked him about it. He told her some BS about how he prefers to pay cash for it. He doesn't pay cash for ANYTHING else. He's basically just trying to hide how much he is spending at the liquor store from her. 

He will have a couple of drinks in front of my SIL each night, and then starts drinking in earnest once she goes to bed. Again, he thinks he's hiding it. He never gets falling down drunk, but on many occasions, he is obviously buzzed. Holidays he gets noticeably more buzzed because his father is usually there. His father has pretty much the same, exact habits as my SB. I know that deep down, SB knows he has a problem, but he won't admit it. He just thinks he enjoys a drink every now and then. But I do think he's cognizant of the fact that in social situations, he tends to be the guy who always has one or two more than everyone else. When his dad is around, it normalizes how much he drinks, because he's not the only one. So he drinks more.

He makes every excuse in the book. He had a long day, it's a special occasion, it helps him sleep (it makes his sleep worse, but he's in denial on that), he's only had a couple drinks, etc. I point out the sleep thing because he falls asleep at soccer games, movies, any event where he's sitting and can sleep. It's embarrassing.

Here's the thing, SIL is ready to leave. She loves him, and it would kill their kids, but she's done. She's had it with the lying. She's also said she's afraid he will get another DWI (he has one conviction from decades ago and one arrest about 15 years ago that he somehow got dropped). She's afraid he's going to lose his job if he starts drinking during the day, if he hasn't already. She doesn't really want to leave; she wants him to get help. But she knows, and I know, that if she gives him an ultimatum - lose his family or get help/stop drinking - he will choose to lose his family. I have sort of confronted him before, and he just gets defensive and says I'm being ridiculous. Either that or he'll say I'm right and that he will cut back, but that just translates to he needs to do a better job hiding it for a while. He'll do the same thing with her. But she is not one to put up with his shit. She's also a lawyer. If they separate, she is prepared to make any visitation with his kids contingent upon him not drinking while they are with him, which he won't/can't do. She is not doing this out of spite, she is truly concerned about their well-being, and I think it's not an unfounded concern. I would not put it past him to drive with them in the car when he's been drinking. It's also just really shitty for them to have to be around that. Pretty embarrassing for a 10 year old when their dad is at a baseball game in the middle of the afternoon, smelling like a distillery, and probably asleep.

So this all breaks my heart. My heart especially breaks for my nephews. But I have a feeling he will take no responsibility if he doesn't get to see them. I'm sure it will all be my SIL's fault because she's the one who won't let him see them. He'll make it out like he's the victim, even though he could totally see his kids if he just didn't drink. I guess my question is, is there any way I can get him to realize that drinking is not more important than your kids and family? Is there any way I can just slap some sense in him and get him to wake up and realize that he's about to lose everything?",2020-08-28 22:45:42

Almost 1 year sober and at a crossroads: abstinence or moderation?,3,ide8bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ide8bh/almost_1_year_sober_and_at_a_crossroads/,11,1597971866.0,"The last drink I had was late at night on August 21, 2019. In a little under 36 hours, I’ll have been sober for a full year. One thing I’ve been thinking about constantly is whether this will be a permanent or temporary change.

See, I love alcohol. I love the confidence and energy it gives me, the beauty it lets me appreciate in otherwise mundane things, the creativity and euphoria that allows me to rise above the ubiquitous stress of modern life. I love how it tastes, I love the culture surrounding it, I love trying out new artisan beers and rare liquors. I love that a tipsy Option2401 is an absolute beast at video games (thanks neural disinhibition!) and a gregarious socialite that doesn’t hold grudges.

After I stopped drinking, I put on 10-20 pounds, fell into a deep depression, and fell behind in the workplace. I found it much harder to cope with stress and setbacks, and became almost entirely socially isolated (even before COVID). It was the opposite I expected to happen, but I stayed sober because I knew factually that not drinking is overall healthier and that these negative effects were a consequence of my psychological withdrawal. Even if I didn’t believe that was the case, I knew it was true.

I kept telling myself, “Just make it a year then you can reevaluate”. I suppose I was hoping my perspective would change, that I could come to some definitive conclusion on how to proceed, but it hasn’t. I don’t want to never drink again; like I said I love alcohol and what it does to my mental state and personality, and a not-so-small part of me genuinely believes that the positive psychosocial effects outweigh the negative physiological effects in terms of overall quality of life. But I also know that abstinence is easier and more reliable than moderation, and that alcohol’s disinhibitory nature makes moderation that much more difficult. I also have an addictive personality and so am at even higher risk for relapse.

In summary, I genuinely believe my best path is to effectively moderate alcohol consumption, but I also believe I lack the will to do so.

I have never discussed my alcoholism and abstinence with other alcoholics - no AA, no support groups, no forums like this one. I think part of the reason why is because it’s easier for me to abstain if it’s “out of sight, out of mind”. Also, my social isolation probably contributed to this as well. Now that a full year is about to roll over, and with no real resolution on my internal debate, I’m hoping to get some feedback from my peers. I haven’t contributed to this community before, so I’m not expecting much, but if anyone has been through a similar internal debate I would value any experiences, perspective, insights, or advice you can share.

"Post-ER Visit, Payment Options, We're doing okay finally <33",2,igt305,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/igt305/poster_visit_payment_options_were_doing_okay/,1,1598448642.0,"This probably doesn't need to be a throwaway but here we are.

Ever since the pandemic hit america, my partner (we are both F25 currently) has been affected by it. She was firstly furloughed, and then later fully fired. Luckily, she has computer skills which are coveted by many, so she found a new job a month after she was officially fired. (I am currently doing housewife work, but I hope to find a job by the end of the year.)

Problem is. We've been drinking every day pretty much all year long because of the bullshit in life happening this year. We realized that, ""hey this is probably not good at all, we should do something about this,"" a couple weeks into july -- she started her new job at the beginning of july. 

Long story short, she had auditory hallucinations, and then had two seizures from alcohol withdrawal. The second seizure I flipped out and called 911 (I wasn't really there for the first one, so she convinced me I was seeing things. Not her fault. She had had a seizure. She didn't know what was happening.) (Tbh I've been drinking a lot less than her, but 3 drinks a day every day is still a lot, I know.) 

So now I/we have multiple issues/problems. We now have a a 2.7$k deductible we owe, from a 12k bill from her ER visit last week. If anyone has any help to make that not so absurd, I would love your input. I figure we can create a payment plan, but I'm very confused as to how insurance plays into affect here, since the bill is so large and it seems like no matter what we'll have to pay the entire deductible for this one night.

I hope to get her to an actual specialist therapist by the end of fall, but she's been doing good ever since the ER visit. 

We haven't actually received a bill from the hospital, as far as I can tell, this is the EOB from her insurance, although I'm quite confused as to when or if I will receive something from the hospital themselves.

Any suggestions or helpful thoughs or words? I would really appreciate it.",2020-08-26 09:30:42
My dad might be suicidal with his drinking. What do i do?,4,igvwvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/igvwvc/my_dad_might_be_suicidal_with_his_drinking_what/,5,1598463853.0,"As the title says my dads drinking has got way out of hand, i’m talking mixing spirits and bourbons with his beers. He will drink a case of six desperados a day without fail since Jan 2020, as some of you may know desperados is one of the higher ABV beers at about 6% per bottle. When i say “day” i mean within the span of around 5 hours (after work till bedtime). For the past month he’s been mixing his beers with very high ABV drinks like vodka, jack daniels and the one i’m most worried about, wray & nephew (63% Alc Jamaican Rum).

I’m yet to reach the worst of it.

He has successfully gone sober for many small periods of times, the longest i recall was the whole year of 2017. Everyone in my family (Mother Brother and Myself) recognises his drinking as a problem, we have confronted him about it multiple times but he always blows it off as a joke or something novel. I know for a fact he has recognised his drinking as a problem because he slyly tries to spread his empty bottles between normal bin and recycling (where all bottles go), my mum asked him “why are you throwing so many bottles in the bin and not the recycling”, his reply: “i don’t want the neighbours seeing how much i drink everyday”, followed by a laugh and a rapid change of topic.

Now that you know the attributes to his Alcoholism...

This is the part that truly wrenches our hearts, he has been diagnosed with dangerously high blood pressure (HBP), where his doctor has prescribed double the recommended dose of HBP tablets (which he fails to take a lot of the time, says he “forgets”), his mother, my grandmother died last year and i still catch him crying late at night in the downstairs toilet, he’s very proud and i can’t build up courage to confront him about being suicidal, when i say suicidal i mean the neglect for his own life, not necessarily the textbook meaning, he is blind in one eye, he’s at risk of glaucoma which plays a huge roll in his HBP, he’s been told numerous times not to consume alcohol by his doctor, he lies to his doctors about drinking and smoking (smoking started around May 2020 and he hasn’t smoked since 2009). He is fully aware of the dangers of HBP, heart attack, stroke and death.

He’s not abusive, if anything it’s small amounts of verbal abuse, when sober he’s fun, nice, caring, fair, level headed. Substance abuse runs in our family, his father drank himself to death in 1989, his sister and her husband are heroin addicts, his youngest brother is on the very severe side of the alcoholic spectrum to the point where everyone has given up on him including his mental health counsellor and doctors, his other sister suffers from similar alcoholism as he does but she’s in pubs everyday so it’s just that little bit worse.

I believe i have a role to play in his alcoholism, i was kicked out of my house early this year and went homeless for about 3 weeks, i’m sure he was worried sick, both my parents were too strict with me (i’ll be 19 in a month), they wouldn’t allow me to leave my house if i haven’t told them: who i’m going with, where i’m going, what time i’ll be back, what i’ll be doing there and worst of all i tell them a time and they’ll change it to an earlier one. I had to break free of that, i believe he was very surprised even disappointed when i came home from homelessness happy and joyful, to him it seemed like i didn’t need parents anymore (which is not the case).

I feel trapped in this feeling of care, that i really really do want to help in any way but somethings also telling me to stay out of his way and try to have the least interactions with him as possible. It’s very confusing.",2020-08-26 13:44:13

Is this alcoholism?,9,ifcbxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ifcbxy/is_this_alcoholism/,10,1598248937.0,"I had always thought of alcoholism in the stereotypical addiction-to-drinking-often, but one of my friends mentioned that alcoholism isn’t necessarily frequency of drinking, but quantity when drinking.

I’m sure this isn’t “healthy” drinking, but it doesn’t happen often and hasn’t progressed over the years. I’m sure it’s some form of problem drinking, but it doesn’t seem to have much general negative impact on my life.

Concerned about a friend,2,iebzrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iebzrx/concerned_about_a_friend/,1,1598098471.0,"Hi all, I was just hoping to share what’s going on with my friend and maybe get some thoughts on it. 

My friendship group has always been very alcohol focused, with lots of partying and binge drinking. However we’ve grown a bit (we’re all early to mid twenties now) and we’ve gotten past the black out drunk phase of life especially with coronavirus occurring. However, one of my friends seems to be still drinking quite significantly at home. She drinks what seems like every day and often talks about how it’s one of her favourite activities. She is not working, studying or really doing anything which I think makes the situation worse — I think for her drinking is one of her main life activities at the moment. She often texts in the evening about how she is drunk and gets very aggressive when drunk. She already has anger issues and drinking only exasperates it. 

I worry that she may be depressed about not having much going on and turning to drinking to cope. I also worry that my other friends encourage it; they joke a lot about drinking to cope and drinking every evening but I know they don’t do it to the extent she does. They also have jobs/college/partners. I recently had to call them out for saying it’s okay to get a drinking problem during lockdown and “just deal with it when lockdown is over.” I think that’s a really bad example to give to our friend but they probably haven’t realised the extent to which this is a problem.

However, the past few nights I’ve drank my anxiety levels have risen to the level of having a panic attack or almost having a panic attack.  I’d like to continue to drink but if this means me having a panic attack after then I’ll have to stop.  

I’m curious if I give myself a little break from alcohol if I’ll go back to just having slight anxiety after drinking.

I (22F) think I have a problem with alcohol. I haven't been diagnosed nor want to call myself an alcoholic (not even a high-functioning one) because I feel like it would undermine people whose struggles with drinking are bigger than mine, but lately I feel like I need some help.

I don't go out as much as other summers because of covid but when I do I don't know when to stop drinking and I always black out and when I wake up in the morning I feel soooo embarrassed over the stuff I have done that I can remember. The last straw has been blacking out twice in one day and then my older brother's best friend (I went out with him and his friends) calling me to let me know what I did. I feel like shit and have been feeling quite depressed lately (this is not alcohol related), so this only worsens it. This hasn't only happened in the summer but this past year too - I went on a study abroad to the US and done things that I don't even want to think about.

I guess I just need advice on how to deal with this. I turn to alcohol when I go out (I love partying and I'm still in college so I go out almost every weekend) because I'm relatively shy. I wouldn't say that I don't know how to have fun sober but it def helps me loosen up and socialize with people I don't know that well. I also drink alone sometimes because I actually enjoy the feeling of being drunk, it makes me forget about my problems. But then I wake up in the morning and feel like shit. Also during the year I skip class sometimes because I get drunk on the weekdays.

Outside of work he exclusively drinks heavily and plays video games.

We thought it was a wake up call when he rolled his car while driving drunk. He somehow walked away from that with just a scratch. He stayed sober for about a month after the crash. He has tried AA maybe once and a church recovery group once but as a video call meeting due to COVID. Since starting to drink again he has driven drunk on more than one occasion.

My parents try to be supportive and want him to take steps to recovery but they feel like they have tried everything with no success. They are worried they are enabling him by letting him live with them. But we don’t know where he would go if they kicked him out.

Looking for help with my fiance's mother.,2,icq79b,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/icq79b/looking_for_help_with_my_fiances_mother/,1,1597880991.0,"Hello, everyone! I have not spent a lot of time in this community, but it seems really helpful and supportive, so here to try and get some help.

My fiance (29) is an only child, her parents have no siblings and no other extended family. It's quite literally just the three of them and has always been as such. Her mom's father struggled with alcohol and depression his entire life, ultimately taking his own life when my fiance's mom was 18. Apparently, my fiance's mom (I'll call her Kim) has struggled silently a lot with alcohol. I think that Kim and my fiance's father always tried to shield her from it and preferred to sweep things under the rug instead of working to heal wounds or deal with conflict. Kim has tried to quit countless times, always without much success, but she always tries to simply do it on her own and is reluctant to tell anyone if she is struggling, preferring to hide that she is drinking again.

My fiance is with her parents this week to simply spend some quality time with them, however, she has discovered all sorts of empty liquor bottles in their laundry room and has told me she knows her mother is drinking again.

I don't have experience with this and my fiance has stated that she doesn't think she's always been great at handling this situation. Her dad either doesn't know or is unwilling to rock the boat enough to actually attempt to heal the necessary wounds. Currently, my fiance is incredibly worried that Kim is isolating, hiding alcohol, ashamed that she is drinking again, and afraid of sharing it and ""dissappointing"" her daughter, and quite possible depressed. In the back of our minds is the reality of what happened to Kim's father, and we simply feel that it will fall on us to be the support system.

Sorry for the long text, but I feel the context is important. Here are the things we want to do and I would just love some feedback on if this is a good approach...

1. We think it's irresponsible if my fiance leaves without discussing this with her mom, but we want to start creating healthy communication regarding her struggles. My fiance plans on first talking to her mom, telling her that she knows she's been drinking, but that she isn't disappointed, that she loves and supports her, and that she isn't judging her. We simply want to be people that she trusts to let in on her struggle so that she isn't struggling alone.

2. My fiance wants to talk to her mom first, but I think that leaving without knowing that her dad is aware is unwise, as we live several hours away and we are concerned about her mental health and well-being.

Has anyone faced similar struggles? Any specific language that you've used in these discussions that have been helpful would be great. Basically, any and all advice is welcome! We just want to get her on the road to recovery, but really aren't sure how. Thanks, all!",2020-08-19 19:49:51

Now that my husband and I are busy with other hobbies, projects etc. We no longer sit for hours on end drinking our faces off resulting in lovely hangover the following day.

They came to visit for the weekend and by 3pm Friday afternoon, they were 3/4 into a 40 and acting very inappropriate. It’s very obvious that the 2 of them do not agree with the way I do things around the house , meals etc and they’re very mouthy when something comes up that doesn’t suit their needs. My husband seems to not notice and I’m constantly having to defend myself with them. This time I choose not to argue with them and just agree with everything they say. This led to them looking for something or anything to rattle me with and I just kept agreeing with them no matter the circumstances. The father-in-law got so drunk that he was crying and slurring something that I had no idea what he was talking about. The pair like to argue and act belligerent in front of my son and my husband just seems to accept it. 

Saturday morning rolls around and they start drinking again. This time my husband mentioned to them that they can drink as long as they didn’t behave the way they were Friday. Well this made them both act like children so they became distant and never spoke a word the entire day. I found this to be very uncomfortable especially when other relatives were visiting at the same time. They left early the following day but before they left I asked the father in law if their was something he wanted to get something off his chest from our so called conversation Friday? He was trying to be pushy with me on Friday so I wanted to call him out in front of my husband to prove a point about their alcohol abuse and then always trying to get on my case. The mother in law pipes up and laughs it off saying he wouldn’t remember anything and if they went. 

This behaviour in front of my son is unacceptable. The level of disrespect these people have with me and in our house is off the charts. My husband brushes it off by saying we don’t see them very often so basically live with it. I’m having a difficult time just sucking this up so I was hoping that I could get some insight or advice on how to handle my in-laws?",2020-08-18 15:32:43

I am in Recovery, but I need your input...",2,i92l7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/i92l7m/my_roommate_is_coming_off_a_threeday_drinking/,3,1597363368.0,"Hey Guys -- My roommate (32 M) and me (31M) (we've only been living together for 2 months, but were high school friends another lifetime ago) is your classic Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde alcoholic.... He isn't mean or abusive when he drinks, but he goes on sprees and he tries to hide most of it in secret in his room. He was noticeably intoxicated the last two nights and then yesterday morning, I heard him crack a can open and I asked him if he was planning on drinking again today and he said -- ""yes, a lot.""

I went upstairs to talk to him and said ""that's fine, but go home and do it and don't come back here until you are sober"" -- because he's had a history with rehab / aa, but it's never stuck for him (denial) -- and he started breaking down and crying and saying he didn't want his parents to know he was drunk... So, I told him, if he wanted to stay here, then he had to give me all his booze -- and he handed over a case of beer and a bottle of vodka -- doubt that was all of it, tbh. I ended up giving him back a few beers later in the evening in case he experienced any DT's or withdrawal effects.

When he initially moved in, even knowing his alcohol history, I am a big believer in people coming to their own realizations -- I told him, I don't care if you get drunk once in awhile -- like big occasions -- wedding-type functions... I said other than that, keep it under control or you are out. He happily agreed and nothing really happen until I started noticing him locking himself in his room more and more and when he'd come down for food. So, he's definitely hiding alcohol in his room -- and I think he is a pretty high-functioning alcohlic so the fact that he couldn't hide his drunkenness the last few days probably shows he is really spiraling to his bottom.

Today he woke up and hasn't left his room. If he drinks again, I'm going to leave and call his mom and tell him he is done here. I can't deal with him when he is drunk a) because he could potentially get violent and b) he'll try to argue and the fact of the matter is there is no argument because he violated our agreement and is disrespecting my recovery. Plus, arguing with him doesn't ever go anywhere, because he is just drunk and he doesn't actually internalize any of it. I also know this because I am a freaking alcoholic in recovery and it was once impossible to negotiate with me when I was drunk!!! I really just want to kick him out or tell him to go home for a week. I don't need this in my life. I don't need him as a roommate -- I just asked him because I was lonely peek COVID-19 because I had broken up with my girlfriend who lived here. I can pay the bills by myself, but he was at least fun to talk to until I started picking up on his drinking. If anyone can offer any feedback on the situation, I'd really appreciate it. I don't know if I'm being to aggressive, but I think as a proud member of AA, I don't need to tolerate somebody that is actively abusing and I know its not my position to make him join AA -- he should want to do it for himself.",2020-08-13 20:02:48
My sister is spiraling. I don't know what to do.,2,ic7bqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ic7bqt/my_sister_is_spiraling_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,5,1597806119.0,"Hi Reddit. Throwaway account because I can't have this personal stuff on my main account.

My sister is 2 years younger than me. She's been an alcoholic for years now, and things are only getting worse. I assumed they got better last year, because her boyfriend threatened to leave her if she didn't get help. She promised to stop drinking alone, and to stop getting drunk. She could still drink in social settings - I thought that was insufficient, but because I don't live close by and don't see her often, I thought maybe it had worked.

Turns out, nope. I found out recently from a friend of hers that it's in fact only gotten much worse. Her friends have held interventions for her, her boyfriend left her and came back, and she's had no job or studies for the past year. My parents are at their wits end, and so am I, especially given that she and I are moving into a flat together next year, and I know she gets violent when drunk. She used to beat me up as a child, and I'm scared this time she'll really break some bones.

Here's the thing. She knows what the problem is. But she refuses to get help. I've offered to take her to AA, but she doesn't want to because it'd ""bum her out"" (no shit). She ""doesn't believe"" in therapy, and, what's more, she still hasn't settled her issues with our healthcare system (universal healthcare), so she has no cover for the time being. My parents live very far and don't really know how to handle it.

I'm desperate at this point. What can I do? I have no experience dealing with addiction in others. It's probably selfish of me, but I can't risk her ruining my last year of uni for me or physically hurting me. I also do not have the means to support her financially, as I rely on precisely calculated loans for my expenses and tuition, and I'm getting worried she'll just eat my food and steal my things. I've tried helping her for years, and it has done absolutely nothing. I'd like to help her get the help and care she needs, but I also want to protect myself. I also can't back out of the move in the apartment next year, it's 100% not feasible for me. 

What can I do? Who can I turn to?

For reference, I do not live in the US, and therefore have no access to the services provided there for alcoholics. I hope I didn't write anything offensive, but if I have, please let me know and I'll make changes where appropriate.",2020-08-18 23:01:59

Friend Becoming Alcoholic,3,ibrpdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ibrpdk/friend_becoming_alcoholic/,1,1597743619.0,"TLDR: I am worried for my friend/roommate, who is going down the path of alcoholism and I need advise on how to approach the topic with them.  

I'm worried about my friend. Let's call them Kay.

&#x200B;

I've known Kay for four years. They were my first friend at my university and we maintained contact and friendship despite the size of our school. They have been good to me, and I will forever appreciate them.

Both of Kay's parents are alcoholics and past hard drug users. I've seen their house once and heard enough about it know it is hoarded full of random stuff, garbage, food, dog hair, alcohol bottles, insects-the point here being their folks aren't the cleanest people. Kay had a tough childhood. They often took care of their parents when they were drunk from a young young age. They're folks would also offer them alcohol when they were younger at times. I've met their mom because sometimes their mom comes over and drinks and encourages them to drink too.  Kay has a lot of trauma from their life. 

When we first moved in at the beginning of the year. Kay was 20 when they moved in so couldn't buy their own alcohol. We live with many other people so we had some alcohol but not a lot since I don't really drink. They turned 21 and started buying alcohol but only drank a lot at gatherings and occasional other times.

I went away for a few weeks because of covid and came back. Kay live in the apartment with another person but for around a month and a half were alone. I came back and the place was nasty. There were flies, food trash all around, the bathroom trash was a person tall, there were weeks old dishes and a lot of alcohol bottles. They are hoarder and hoarded a lot of stuff as well so much that all the counters were covered in their stuff. They have begun blacking out frequently now. Drinking a lot each night (8-11 drinks). They aren't a large person but they have always had high tolerance. 

I cleaned up the apartment but it seems that when they get drunk they leave trash about/don't clean it at all. Their drinking has made them unpredictable and some of their actions are out of hand.  I know they dropped all but one class last semester and have had academic issues that has been causing them stress. They don't eat well and don't have a lot of energy these days. They sleep or play video games for the most part. When drunk they are mean, and it has been causing them issues with other people. They also were not like this before alcohol. 

I contacted a mutual friend who recognized the same issues and sympathized. We are both concerned about Kay and find it difficult to see them go down this path. I'm not here for very much longer (around 2 weeks), and i wish I could help them. I am planning to have a heart to heart with them. I have never mentioned their alcoholism to them but they have acknowledged they have it before while very drunk. 

&#x200B;

I don't know if there is anything I can do to help them besides a heart to heart given the time. I do care a lot about them. They don't have access to therapy right now. I want to know what to say to them about. They are defensive about it according to our mutual friend. I know they haven't been like this for too long, but I know early intervention is a thing. 

They are really a great person and friend. I need advice on how to bring this up, because it is a touchy subject.",2020-08-18 05:40:19
When is the right time to ask for help?,7,ibk1vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/ibk1vl/when_is_the_right_time_to_ask_for_help/,11,1597718410.0,"Hi all, been lurking for a little while. I've been thinking about the way I drink for a few months now and I'm wondering if its the right time to get help or whether I'm just being dramatic. 

Basically, I started drinking when I was sad at age 13. Back then it would only be 1, just to make me feel better,  and it worked. But I think I was in reality doing some prep work - a kid who drinks when they're sad is gonna become an adult who drinks when they're depressed, right?

I developed severe depression at 15 which I have been managing ever since. Its impacted every aspect of my life. I carried on drinking in the same way occasionally to help out, but I was on a lot of different medications then so I didn't go as far as I wanted to, as to avoid chemical interactions. When I became an adult (18 in uk), my usage changed a bit. I stopped taking antidepressants at this time because none of them worked, and as I was older, I had more access to alcohol than ever before. I had spells of binge drinking when I got really down, one time I overdid it by drinking every night consecutively for a few days. That incident scared me off of alcohol 'forever' (2 months). At the time these binges weren't too frequent so I didn't think much of it.

This year however, has been a little different. My stress has been off the charts (I'm sure yours has been too). In May I did some more frequent drinking, and I noticed how amazing I felt. My mood was great. My anxiety was gone. I could function normally. My brain came to the conclusion that I no longer wanted to be sober, and then everything changed. The pursuit began. Alcohol became  on my mind 24/7. Nothing brought me joy anymore. I'd try to do things but nothing would hit. And each time I drank, it became more than last time. I knew something was off then, but I always argued with myself. ""You don't have a problem because you haven't done xyz"", then a week later I'd end up doing xyz. Each time it would escalate a bit more, and im finding it difficult to stop once I start. My mother has stopped buying any alcohol for me because she found out what I was up to. I've always drank alone but now I have become more secretive than ever. I don't want to hurt her feelings. 

But I'm still not sure if I have a problem. There's no way I developed it that fast, right? It was like a switch was flipped - I thought it was a gradual process that people took years to even recognise they were even in, and I'm somehow here at the snap of a finger? Or what if I'm not, and my brain is making up the whole thing?

I can also go weeks without alcohol, but the longer it becomes, the more I want it again. I can't afford to buy a  lot so I have these gaps. I feel like if I had more money (and there was no covid) I would be using more frequently.

Is it time for something to intervene? I have been thinking about buying some books just to help when it gets in my head, or maybe looking at a meeting or something, but I feel like I'm not bad enough to deserve help. Maybe I don't need help and I'm just being silly and over the top?

Some background: I struggled with alcohol mostly in my early twenties. I have a strong family history of alcoholism (dad, mom, aunt, uncles) and I had quit drinking about two years ago. I slowly allowed myself to casually drink when I wanted and I found that I could control it most times & I also see a therapist. 

Lately I have been having the urge to drink everyday since I recently got a new puppy in April and he’s been a lot of work & also due to COVID. I think I’m resorting to it as a way of looking forward to something, and I also sometimes smoke a bit as well to truly relax.

He is still employed, and a small house comes with the job! Now, I can buy a 12 pack and it's gone in under a week. Some days I don't drink, or I have one. He very quickly gets to the beer when he is off work. I've started storing what I buy in my room so he doesn't drink it all. I've lost so much money because I'll buy beer for socially distanced bonfires and then half of it is gone days before people come over. It's easy math to see he is drinking 2-3 a day. So in addition to hiding the beer and trying to simply give him one from my mini fridge at dinner, I've tried to say ""Yeah, we are out. No big deal. Have a pop or a water. So will I."" I've discussed my concern with his drinking and it's been dismissed. Now today I heard glass clanging in his room so when he went to the store I peeked inside. I found two bottles of beer swiped from a variety pack friends brought over yesterday that I stupidly left on the porch and in his closet were multiple empty Budweiser boxes and bottles and a bucket with melting ice and bottles inside. He is married to my mother still but she took a job out of state. I feel like it's intervention time. I've tried to discuss my concerns but he brushes them off or lies to me. ""Yeah, I didn't drink 12 beers from the 24 pack in four days. My friend was over while you were gone. He had two."" I'm like ""that still means you had ten in four days...""

Since losing my job this spring (obvious reasons) I started day drinking, and this has become much more severe. I'm a 115lb female, and I used to get knocked to the floor with 1 shot. Now I'm going through 1/3 bottle of Vodka every day. 

I definitely used it as a way to cope with anxiety, but it got to the point where I if couldn't have a little every hour, I'd start getting horrifyingly anxious. I couldn't even get through a full night of sleep without waking up for a fix. I had to get plastered to even feel okay, but then how am I going to live my whole life that way? I'm falling behind on the little work I do from home, and I've basically disappeared socially. 

Starting today, I'm going sober. I weaned for a few days, but the feeling of doom is unstoppable. I can't even read a book or have coherent thoughts, it all just gets eaten by anxiety. I just lie there staring at the ceiling. The only good thing is that my partner is also going sober with me, and we've been taking care of each other with food, water, walks, etc.

After waking up in the morning, starved & dehydrated, I found I had puked on 2 spots on a rug I really liked, on 2 pairs of good shoes, and on the pillow I slept on.

Teenager and dead inside,4,iaiaeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/iaiaeh/teenager_and_dead_inside/,3,1597564597.0,"Sorry if this wall of text is going to be hard to understand, I'm currently 17 years old. I'm very short (5'2) which might not seem relevant but it is. I had my first drink at 14 and was imminently hooked, I had one 4.5% cider which gave me a very nice buzz, considering my weight and height it was enough for me to get tipsy. My mother doesn't love me, I know this for a fact because she has always let me know throughout my life, I'm the result of an unwanted pregnancy which also happened to result in her going into postpartum psychosis. I also suffered a head injury at the age of 2 which resulted in my amygdala taking damage, it has been my reason for my fearlessness and anti-social behavior. She still blames me for ruining her life. 

My mother has always been an alcoholic throughout my life so it only adds to her rage. When I first started to drink it made me happy, it helped me with my suicidal thoughts, and actually made me think positively about life, but all good things must come to an end. Eventually, my 4.5% cider wasn't enough for me to get those happy moments, I needed more. So I started to drink her wine, it started at half a liter but as time went by I was drinking 2 liters of 12,5% a day, and when that wasn't good enough I made the foolish decision of stealing 2 liters of 40% vodka from Systembolaget (the Swedish alcohol monopoly). 

I came to the realization that I'd eventually get caught if I kept stealing so I started drinking Alcogel instead (Swedish 85% hand sanitizer). I knew it was a stupid thing to do but I didn't care, I just wanted my life to end. Eventually, I grew a pair and decided to kill myself rather than to just take to slow route out.  I swallowed roughly around 40 pills of paracetamol if I remember correctly (20g) and was finally truly happy, happy thinking I was going to die finally. Well considering the fact that I'm still here to post this, I'd say I failed, but what actually did fail was my kidneys.

When I woke up following my suicide attempt I felt really sick, I threw up the entire day but as the day went on this very sharp pain was building up all over my back, it got so bad that I was sobbing in my bed unable to move. I eventually passed out and woke up at the hospital, for some odd reason they never actually came to the conclusion that I'd attempted to kill myself but I was thankful that they didn't because I was only planning on actually killing myself when I got home, my plan was to either hang myself or to just stab myself in the neck. While at the hospital I was going through withdrawal but not horrible enough for me to go into psychosis, it was still manageable weirdly enough. 

When I got home 5 days later I didn't immediately go back to alcohol for an easy escape. I decided to give another shot, I had left 9th grade with really good grades after all so I thought that there might have been the beginning of a new chapter in my life. Boy, I was wrong! 

When I started at my new gymnasium I began to grow more and more paranoid for no apparent reason. I was still acing tests with ease but I hadn't made any new friends, none at all, it was just me and only me just like my life before. So I started doing Oxycodone rather than alcohol, I stole it from my mother who had tons of pills from years of abuse, but usually whenever I'd taken anything before I'd be happy but now now I was still suicidal even with painkillers involved. 

Last November my dad was taken by the police for false accusations made by my mother, she had accused him of abuse when in reality it was always she that was abusive I have the physical scars to prove it.  She had also accused me which resulted in an entire court case against me and my dad, the accusations were so bad in fact that an entire news article was written about it. It painted me and my dad as lunatics who had tortured her for years even though there was no physical proof for the accusations the only proof that that actually exist was that she'd been abusive towards me. But the article, of course, didn't include that.

No names were mentioned in the article but it was enough information for the kids at school to realize that the article was written about me and my dad. So people started to completely avoid me. So I decided that enough was enough and attempted to commit suicide by cop.

Here I am, now dependant on alcohol and Gabapentin wanting to quit. Any advice on how to handle withdrawal?",2020-08-16 03:56:37

I (31F) had my drinking under control for a good while until recently. I’m going through the breakup of a 5-year emotionally abusive, toxic relationship. We still have some contact unfortunately because they won’t take me off the apartment lease, though I’ve left and gotten my own place. I still miss them constantly despite knowing they’re bad for me, and not a decent person in general, and I’m feeling incredibly alone. 

I stayed with my parents for a few months and was doing okay during that time (especially during quarantine with everything shut down) but now that I’m living alone with my thoughts all day (and working from home) I’ve found myself going out drinking nightly again. I’m starting to feel sick and hungover more days than not and I’m scared that I won’t be able to pull myself out or something worse will happen. I don’t have any friends I can stay with at the moment and my parents aren’t an option due to me having gone out and my mom being immunocompromised. I want to cut back slowly so that I can moderate or even quit without withdrawals but I just feel stuck.

Casual drinking or a serious problem?,2,i7eray,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/i7eray/casual_drinking_or_a_serious_problem/,12,1597125802.0,"I'm a 34 year old male and I would describe myself as a social drinker - I like the buzz of alcohol and the way it enhances everyday situations. I find alcohol funny and exciting. I mainly drink in the evenings: watching TV, playing games etc. Plus every outing with friends is a good excuse to drink yet again.

I'm not binging like I used to in college - my evening is 3-4 beers, rarely more. I get a buzz going, do some things and after a few hours I finish up with some water and simply go to bed. Not harming anyone but my liver, I suppose. The sleep quality is shitty and my mornings are usually kinda hard, but I get up early enough to do some work, hit the gym and do all the usual daily chores. In the evening I grab a beer to take the edge of the little hangover that's left and the cycle starts again.

My wife is pushing me - gently - to limit my drinking to social occasions, but I find it hard to occupy myself in the evenings. I need some stimuli or else I become bored. Every activity is somewhat more interesting with a beer in hand. I do have some days off, either completely sober or with a little weed (very little, I'm not much of a smoker), but I have to try really hard to fill up my time with something which does not require drinking. I can stay sober if I'm tired enough in the evening or if I have something important to do the next day.

When I do have two or three days off of alcohol, I feel great, of course. More energetic, with a positive outlook and some additional enthusiasm for everyday stuff. I enjoy the little things for a day or two and after that a party happens or a friend visits, I get drunk, have a hangover and need to grab a drink the next day, just to take the edge off. And the cycle begins again.

I don't think I drink to solve anything, or to forget or to mask anything. I just enjoy the hell out of it and for years my drinking has stayed on the same level - a few beers a night.

My father drinks the same way, but maybe with a few beers more (he finishes all his nights with two cups of tea and he's well asleep around 9pm). At weekends he sometimes starts drinking before noon and generally gets seriously buzzed each time he drinks - still, a happy drinker, no problems, no violence, just some slurred speech and an all around friendly disposition.

My mother criticises my fathers drinking, but drinks vermouth each day herself. So there is some alcohol in the family, although both my parents get up early to work (managerial positions) and have been doing this for years. No escalation is happening.

So, while I have a history of alcohol in my closest family, I still don't think it's really an issue. If it is - I'm yet to find the cause of it. But since it does bother my wife - and I do enjoy being sober once in a while - I decided to at least consults you, dear Reddit. Are my drinking habits dangerous or managable? And how should I go about severely limiting my alcohol intake, without giving it up completely?",2020-08-11 02:03:22

But he then continued smoking and drinking again. Not so long ago - about two months ago - he got a second stroke, this time worse, he couldn't move his upper right body and couldn't talk properly for 2 weeks, he then slowly realized that he really had to stop smoking and drinking, so he did for a while, up to now he has stopped smoking, but he has recently started drinking again and going out with his drinking ""friends"" and coming back home 2:30 am in the morning, sometimes even at 5:30. He does this weekly :(. And I am sure that if this keeps going on, the unfortunate might happen again or even worse. 

My dad is 65 and my mom is 44, they both live in Indonesia whilst I am currently studying in The Netherlands - and my mom is really upset and disappointed by his actions because she knows that he is not young anymore and I do too, and if something bad happens to him then my mom would have to take care of him all alone in Indonesia, and it would be really a shame if my mom had to take care of him just because he couldn't stop with his bad behavior. My dad isn't working as well right now due to COVID and my mother is doing the work.

My mom has warned me all of my life that my dad was an addict. He was addicted to alcohol and cocaine. I only saw him ever other weekend, and because my mom was so against it and I didn’t see my dad all that often, I was obsessed with the thought of it because it seemed “mature.” At the beach, beginning at 13 my dad and stepmom would have me have a glass of wine or drink with them. Telling me it was because I was so mature. I felt so “cool” at the time. I was straight edge and a mover and shaker overachieving kid. And thought it was cool when they would ask me to have a drink. I only ever had one. Never getting tipsy but I remember wanting to know what it felt like. Even as a kid, after watching my dad drink when he had custody I would ask my mom if the waitress at Olive Garden could put apple juice in a wine glass for me. To be “lady like.” Well, eventually my dads drinking started disgusting me. In late high school I thought it was cool and edgy and a way for me to finally let my hair down by drinking some. I never got drunk. My friends and I maybe 3 times got a little bit of liquor from our parents cabinet and mixed it with coke, never getting even tipsy. I wasn’t infatuated with it, but I did like the idea of not always following the rules and being the overachiever I felt I needed to be all the time. The first time I really remembered getting drunk was at my high school graduation party with friends. I HATED the way I felt the next morning. I was so embarrassed. Over my senior year I had smoked maybe 3 times. Again, didn’t really like being out of my mind and body but liked that it made me “cool” even though only my “cool friends” could know. I never wanted my mom to know anything, even though I barely did anything, because I knew she’d just warn me about my dad. My senior year summer I went to hangout festival and drank but always was never more than tipsy and could always drive us back whereas my friends would get wasted. 

In college I went out a few times and drank, got drunk some of those times but not consistently. Just enough at the beginning to have a fun time. But I always kept tabs on everyone and would help them out, I wouldn’t be sober doing it, but I never let myself get too drunk or sloppy. Again, this was only maybe once every two weeks in my first semester of college. I loved the social part of it. Wine nights, etc. but I had the car and always would never get drunk so I could drive us back to the dorms. That same semester, though I had only smoked a handful of times, I began smoking with people I deemed “cool.” During that time I found that weed helped me sleep significantly. Something I had always had anxiety about (especially at my dads) as a kid. I started off just socially. Eventually when the “cool” people said we had to start buying it on our own we did. We wanted to pitch in. In 6-8 months my friend group and I went from splitting 1/8 all together, to then my friend saying we all had to start buying our own because she wanted to smoke more. This friend group would always say they “couldn’t sleep without it” and that made me so nervous. Once I started smoking I lost any interest I had in drinking. Smoking was the cool thing, I didn’t like the upbeat lifestyle of drinking and partying. I may have had a glass of wine while smoking with friends. But I never drank alone or bought it. My freshman year of college I began smoking a lot more. By sophomore year, I believed what my friends had said about NEEDING weed for sleep. I just accepted that as my truth too. 

Summer after sophomore year I got a job touring for a summer where we couldn’t smoke (we didn’t get drug tested, but I deemed it orogesssional and said I didn’t want to) I LOVED the way I felt. I loved not needing weed to sleep. However, the girl I met who is now my girlfriend was 22 and liked to drink. I told her about my dad, how I like drinking but don’t have a taste for it and I don’t drink when I’m sad or alone because my mother had knocked the fear into me about my dad.

That first summer without weed my girlfriend introduced me to drinking sometimes, but again, I was 20 and I enjoyed it and we got tipsy/drink occasionally but not much. She was a pretty heavy drinker and I ended up driving for her. I didn’t like it when she was drunk, but I didn’t mind it if we were both tipsy.

Then, back to my junior year I started back smoking (this time not fun like it used to be, but instead to numb from some toxic shit I wanted to escape). Everyone in my friend group did, and though I wanted to stop I just said “what’s the point? I miss my gf and this year has been so hard.” 

Then, summer of my junior year I went back touring with my girlfriend. Again, no weed. I was 21. We drank a lot. More than I would have liked to admit. We drank almost every night and I felt at that point in my life (where I hadn’t the first tour) like I needed either booze or trazodone to sleep. I’d drink like 1-5 drinks a day. All in good fun, we thought we were just young and saw nothing wrong with it.

Well, now in this last year we have been living together in Chicago and smoke daily. We rarely drink unless we go out, and even then it’s a drink or two at dinner or a brunch. But smoking for me got really bad. Escape. I recently started Marijuana anonymous because the smoking with quarantine got out of hand for me. 

But with stopping smoking, I haven’t drank. I am doing so purposely because I don’t want to replace the habit. I have done a shit ton of therapy and found that my root for escape from weed came from a lot of trauma I blocked out and did not healthily work through. My dad, is 53 and in end stage alcoholism. I am now trying to get him in rehab to save him. While I believe weed to be a thing over me that has me powerless, I have not felt that way about alcohol. With the exception of that summer I drank too much. Now that I have identified the root of my need to escape, is it bad if I have drink? I feel like my mom and everyone is in my ear since I have chosen to be honest about weed. And I already am paranoid to ever drink. But at such a young age I don’t feel like I should be freaking out or have to prove If I have a beer or two or a glass of wine at a social event. I also don’t want to become my dad. I just DONT see that happening but I’m sure he didn’t see this happening to him either. Any advice based on him and my experiences growing up?",2020-08-03 08:39:27

My brother is an alcoholic and he is struggling. He resides in Denver but has moved back home to TN for a DUI court date, which is in 18 days. He can't keep water, or food down and he is currently drinking about a pint of vodka a day. He used to drink a handle a day. He doesn't have insurance. Not even medicaid. We have desperately tried to get him set up with a temporary state ID here in TN for medicaid but things have been difficult. He failed his eye test fo me a drivers license. So we resulted to a temporary ID which he needs the original copy of his SS card. Which is back in storage in Denver. So we are currently seeking a replacement card through the SS website. 

He doesn't want to get anything done. There are days he wants to help himself, but others where it's just beating around the bush of bullshit. It's taken a toll on both parents and myself. Both parents are on social security and barley receive enough to get by on their own, now they have a 26 year old son living with them. Dad has Alzheimer's so thats enough stress as is. I barley make enough to support myself and student loans. 

 Do you think if we were to go to the courthouse and spoke to someone, hopefully close to the judge, could we ask for an EARLY court appointed IOP (intensive outpatient program) so he wouldn’t have to pay? His court date isn’t for 18 days but if he says he needs help, do you see them offering anything? 

Please help. We have tried everything. I don’t know what to do. He pretty much sleeps all day. I don’t want him to drink himself to death. So here I turn to reddit. If you have any advice. it would be appreciated!",2020-08-05 03:44:49

I was once even at a party where everyone else was drunk except for me, so I'm not interested in doing it for social/party reasons.

I (42f) have been dating a guy (40m) for a year and a half.  He has serious mental health issues, as do I (we met in group therapy, lol). His issues are much more severe, however, and have kept him from having much human interaction and leaving the house for things other than doctor's appointments for 20 years.  When we got together, I knew he had the mental issues he has, but what I didn't realize was how much he was using alcohol to cope.  I was under the impression that for the first couple of months we were seeing each other he didn't drink, he corrected me on this this weekend and said he did the whole time.  He wouldn't have been able to interact with me otherwise.  When I did start to see how much he drank, I wasn't overly concerned because he is never mean, or abusive when he drinks.  He is usually just relaxed and pretty ""normal"".  He has blood tests he has to take every few months because of a medical issue and the results came back that his kidney function is off and he has low potassium.   He believes the drinking is the culprit and is trying to cut down.  I am 100% behind him and will do whatever he needs me to do to help.  Here is the problem...my bf's mental health is so bad that none of the pills he has ever been prescribed work.  The only thing he has ever used that helped him is alcohol, which he never touched until he was 38 (2 years ago). Since beginning to drink, he has done so many things he has never done before like dating me, going to the movies, going hiking, staying away from home for extended periods of time, going in stores etc. He told me this weekend he can't do any of those things without alcohol.  He is extremely depressed without it and in a constant state of panic.  He said he can't interact with me sober (which I don't believe to be true,  but it is what he thinks ) and he doesn't know how that will effect our relationship.  I am left here reeling from the news.  I feel like he is saying that we need to go to a fwb situation, and I can't do that.  I don't want him to hurt his body further by drinking, but it helps his mind so much.   I feel selfish wanting him to continue drinking, but I am scared to death I am going to lose him without it.  Overall, I care enough about him to support him if he decides to cut back significantly or to quit, regardless of the outcome for me.  But, I am confused and scared at the moment.  I am wondering if anyone has known someone like my boyfriend?  If anyone has been in a similar situation?  Or if anyone with experience with alcoholism and mental health has any opinions.  I welcome any and all feedback (except nasty comments). For the record, we do drink together on the weekends quite often, but I only drink with him and don't have a problem going without it.  It is more social for me than anything.

If I stop drinking I start shaking and sweating by 2, only now I’ve made a promise and need to commit today or never. 

I’m loosing touch with my high school friends and was doing but so well that I managed to kick drinking months before covid with their support, but since the of boredom in quarantine, I’ve been drinking at least 4-5 drinks a day since march.

I’m ashamed for them to see me like this so I ignore their calls and messages. They probably think I’m upset with them.

I’ve been through this before, I saw that it was destroying my life to the point of drinking in inappropriate places like work. I’ve been able to kick arguably nastier habits like tobacco and opiates before. I know I’ll need inner strength to get through these next 3-4 days without hurting myself further. Last time I was shaking under a blanket barely able to move by day 3 and had to go to the ER.

I’m ready to pour my cider, beer and scotch down the drain and never look back if that’s what it takes to have a future. Quarantine is temporary and life should be more than a nasty cycle of hangovers and regrets.

I’m a 21yo and my little brother of 18yo has had some drinking problems lately. He’s a very introverted guy and has few friends. He quit school at 17 even though he’s very smart, because he’s bad at working for something he’s not interested in. Which is why he’s now home every day and changed his whole sleeping schedule only dedicated to playing chess online. He’s never outside the house, only to play chess at a local company every tuesday night. He has a few mates there but they usually drink aswell so idk if its a good influence either.
He hates to be outside and has social anxiety. He has been tested for autism ADHD & stuff but he doens’t seem to have any, which makes all of this even more confusing for me to understand.

He started stealing my dad’s beer when he was about 16. It started pretty innocent and he’d do it once a month. My mom did tell him to stop but he continued and since my parents are divorced and my dad himself drinks beer 3 times a week aswell, my brother can do what he wants.

It’s been getting worse, stealing wine that I bought and was supposed to be for me and my girlfriends, stealing more beer and beer and seeing him very drunk at night, sometimes puking.

I wrote him a letter in which I explained my worries. He cried and told me he wants to stop it. I really hoped it would work, but it didnt. My mom has also had so many convos with him about it, but he doesnt stop.

Just today, when I thought it was kinda going better, I found a box in his room, with 8!!!! bottles of strong alcohol. Vodka, whiskey and even jagermeister. 4 empy 4 full. He ordered them himself, which must have been like 70 euros, though he hasn’t ever had a job in his life and is just spending my dad’s saved up money for his education.
So i confronted him and he ignored me and told me Im dramatic. I full on exploded and yelled how sad I am, it was an emotional words vomit and since then i’ve been crying for hours. My dad knew about it, which makes it so much more painful as i’m also dissapointed in him... 

It breaks my heart to see him like that.. its very hard on me. I work in a psychiatric hospital so I know how things can escalate. Addiction runs in the family and to see my little brother like this hurts like hell. I’m so scared he’s an alcoholic and will turn out miserable and homeless... I know this might not help and i dont exactly know what I want out of this post but I guess some friendly words or same experiences or advice would help, also to not feel so damn lonely and sad.",2020-08-03 17:33:15
Drinking while in college,2,hzq5cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hzq5cu/drinking_while_in_college/,2,1596009844.0,"So I'll preface this with the fact that I'm in college. I'm 19. About to enter my second year. I'm getting an apartment with three other roommates. Obviously, everyone's excited about having their own space and getting drunk together and parties and shit (covid limited). We already have plans for getting a table for beer pong and shit like that. The problem is that I have a problem with alcohol. My roommates know a little bit but not the extent. I want to participate in everything but I also don't want to completely fuck over my education (which I did a decent bit first year). I don't want to be controlled by alcohol, but if it's a constant theme, what am I supposed to do?",2020-07-29 04:04:04

Can this really be happening so soon? I’m in a great mood lately and have patience again! Quit the drink and smoking last week. 

I know everybody is different, but I hope those just starting sobriety like me experience this “glow” too.

I wasn’t Ms. Crabby Pants all the time, but I was aware it was happening way too much, and looking back at my reactions, just plain unnecessary.  I owe my hubby a huge apology.  Been married 33 years. 

My anger got worse over the last decade+ with the increased drinking. Luckily we do have a lot of fun together, and both have a great sense of humor, along with wonderful, funny families. He is quite the opposite mood-wise. Peeps would joke I was a saint to put up with HIM because he is very social and the life of the party. I would half-heartedly chuckle at their observation, and my inner voice would scream: if they only knew that awful part of me.

Just don't know how to go on,6,i21828,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/i21828/just_dont_know_how_to_go_on/,7,1596349926.0,"If anyone can be bothered to read this I would really appreciate it. I started self- medicating with alcohol to deal with my anxiety, depression and OCD about 3 years ago and it's been a downward spiral ever since.

I'm currently drinking around 500- 700 ml of vodka every single day because it's the only way for me to cope and function with everyday life and go through the simplest tasks like having to shower etc. Every morning I wake up I have a panic attack and can only calm myself by having a drink straightaway.

I've been hiding this habit from all my friends and family all these years. But now my physical health is really impacted and I had to come clean to my husband ( and he's been very supportive) I made the decision I really want to stop so went to see a doctor.

I was so relieved that I finally went to seek help, but so far it's all just been a kick in the teeth. I don't know how the process works in different countries (I'm in the UK), but I was basically just given a phone number for alcohol addiction. GP says there's nothing they can do because they're not allowed to prescribe any medication so you can safely detox at home.

Anyways, I rang up this place and even to get a telephone appt to talk to someone is over 3 weeks.

Things are going downhill so rapidly with my health now, I've got terrible gastritis and am in pain all the time, am constantly vomiting and not able to hold food down, I can't even take my anxiety meds anymore, because I just throw them up again straight away.

Yet the thing I can't do is stop drinking because it's what gives me the only mental relief.

I'm also so terrified of stopping, because I start getting withdrawal symptoms just after about 6 hours without alcohol and I'm worried I might have a seizure and die.

I honestly can't imagine I could get better without someone locking me up and forcing me not to drink, but going into rehab isn't an option, firstly because of covid, and secondly because I just can't afford private treatment.

This has become quite a ramble, I just wanted to get it off my chest. If there's anyone out there who's gone through a similar experience please let me know and maybe share some tips how I can cope until I even get to that first milestone of having that phone consultation in 3 weeks.

Obviously not asking for medical advice, just for any little strategies that get me through the time while I wait.

Thanks for listening.",2020-08-02 02:32:06
Am I (20m) still an alcoholic?,1,hwvow2,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hwvow2/am_i_20m_still_an_alcoholic/,3,1595595785.0,"This is going to be kind of a long text so bear with me. 

Well, I don't even know if I was one in the first place. My friends called me that as a joke because I could outdrink any of them. I study and practice law in Mexico City so alcohol is always present. I don't know about other countries but in Mexico, lawyers and law students have a reputation of being heavy drinkers. 

I started drinking in high school about once a week and I felt pretty good about it. Over the time, upon starting college, I started noticing that I was drinking two or three times a week but I just assumed that was because I was just meeting a bunch of different people who would invite me to a bunch of different social gatherings. Every time I drank I got drunk, but didn't have any blackouts. I only drank alone like once or twice in my life. August 2019 to March 2020 was my worst period. My law friends and me used to park in the Faculty of Philosophy parking lot everyday where there's no security so we could blast Luis Miguel and drink. We started drinking at 9 or 10 am and we missed a lot of classes. I would drink at least 2.5 liters of beer and about four to five cubas libres. Everyday. Sometimes, at 1 or 2 pm we would maybe go eat something and then continue drinking at my place until 2-3 am. This was on weekdays. During this time I did show up drunk to work at least in 3 different occasions (I only need to go to the office once a week). No one said anything about it but I do think some of my coworkers and even my boss noticed. During this period I also missed a very important exam early in the morning because I was hungover and I would get below average grades when I've always been an all A's student. 

Weekends were when shit went up a notch. I was drinking half a bottle of a 1 liter Bacardi white at the very least on Fridays and Saturdays plus like 4 or 5 beers. Most of the time it was more. Always socially, though most of the time I ended up puking. On Sundays we traditionally have family gatherings and I would mostly have up to 7 beers. I cheated on my girlfriend several times and I've always blamed it on the booze. 

During this period I started considering that I was an alcoholic and that what my friends said about my drinking was true. Most of them do drink but when they're done they're done. They knew when to stop or they just went to sleep. I always found that I wanted to keep drinking even if it was pretty late or everyone was already asleep. Also during this period, what I consider my rock bottom is that one time a friend kicked us out of his apartment because he was getting noise complaints. I had just met a really nice guy that day who is a doctor that lived just three floors below. My friends went home but the doctor said to me that I could stay and drink with him for a while. I wanted to keep drinking. We ended up going on a three day bender with no sleep and before I knew it it was already Monday. 

Now what's curious is that ever since the quarantine started I have only drank like 4 or 5 times. I have felt cravings but no withdrawal symptoms. I have felt a lot better physically but not mentally though. The only time during this quarantine that I've gotten really really really drunk was when my buddies and me went to a friend's house in a small, almost paradise-like small villa (with 0 active covid cases) near Querétaro. I rationalized my excessive drinking because I said to myself that I would not get the chance to get that drunk with my friends in a long while. I ended up so drunk that my friends couldn't wake me up when they needed my help to deal with an aggressive maniac (that's another story). 

That was the last time I drank and it was about a month ago. I still feel guilty because of what my inaction caused. I do not intend to stop drinking completely but I wanna be a regular drinker. I wanna be able to know when to stop. I don't want my drinking to keep interfering with my personal, laboral and academic life. I would absolutely love to hear some feedback.

Edit: the legal drinking age in Mexico is 18.",2020-07-24 09:03:05

The re-wiring that my body had to go through over the past month was so intense that there were times that I thought that I couldn't handle it. 

As vain as it may sound, a picture changed my mind. I don't take a lot of pictures of myself but I got dressed up last week for a friend's socially distant wedding and decided to take a snap of my look. I posted it to social media and every time it would pop up on my timeline, I had to remind myself that it was me. 

I look in the mirror and my eyes are brighter, my face isn't swollen and tired, and my body is finally settling down from the withdrawal. I feel better today than I have felt in the past 3 years.",2020-08-01 09:29:16
So.. I have a friend that...,1,i1jgnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/i1jgnn/so_i_have_a_friend_that/,0,1596272735.0,"Hey there,

It’s my (26M) first time posting something in here but I feel I need to do something as I think I have a problem with alcohol and mood disorders.

It’s not a case of needing alcohol and having a sort of dependence from it but more as an abusive way to alienate myself so I could be in a different state of mind and avoid falling into the void of existence. 

I would like to have a good relation with alcohol but it seams impossible to have a responsible attitude over it. Moreover, I also think that alcohol makes me even more depressed and then I get inside of the loop of abusing it with no control and without caring about anything else. Then, I usually end up having arguments with my GF(26) and now we got into a point that she told me she can’t trust me and that every time we go out she doesn’t have fun because she feels I will fuck it up, or make something that bothers her, and I don’t want to put her in this horrible situation as it makes me feel incredible guilty as I hate myself for not knowing how to deal with this problem and also because I’m hurting her. 

I’m a really impulsive person. I was told I had ADHD when I was a kid but I didn’t follow any sort of treatment. I really would love to be able to ease my bad judgemental impulses I usually have due to my hyperactivity, and also stop abusing alcohol. I read that alcohol affects the frontal lobe, the same part of the brain as ADHD. When the prefrontal cortex of an ADHD sufferer is further impaired by alcohol, it can lead to uncontrollable behaviors and wild emotions. That is how I usually feel when I drink.

IDK I’m so confused. I still want to have social life and be able to enjoy a drink but I just think I won’t be able to just do it.

I know I should start facing this issue as a problem but I don’t know what to do.

Thank u in advance <3",2020-08-01 05:05:35

Now it’s July and I’m bloated, people have commented at work how I was looking pretty fit for a while and now ask what happened to that me.

I only have my sister in my life, never been in love and probably never will be, no friends. So of course when I’m not working I drink and smoke until my world is bearable enough through my inebriated mind. Recently though even when I’m shitfaced my depressed thoughts find a way in. 

Drunk me laughs easier, smiles easier, truly enjoys what he is doing with a hearty laugh. Sober me feels like I put a mask on when I act happy at work. So I just drink constantly. Work at 4 pm? Taking 14 shots between 9-10:30 and wake up at 3:20. Finish the bottle when I get off. Pass out from that and wake up at 1 am? Open another bottle and drink all night till I wake up and repeat.

I realize it’s horrible for my body but what the fuck does it matter. Not like I’m going to wake up one day and be a social butterfly, attracting friends and relationships. Just going to be a friendless virgin who kills himself eventually, if my body doesn’t give out before that.

Dealing with alcoholism.,3,i0b4ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/i0b4ve/dealing_with_alcoholism/,5,1596093850.0,"Just a little background; My husband is about to be 34. We've been in love for 9 years now. No children. He has always drank since he was 17 but it used to be subtle like weekends or socially. 

The past 2 years, we've dealt with alot of trauma. My place of employment closed suddenly so I was out of work for 3 months. He was working part time at that time. So he couldn't handle all the bills for those 3 months & we lost our only car. Then in turn he lost his job and hasn't been able to get back to work full time since then. We live in a small town where there's no work & haven't been financially well enough to purchase another car. He's been working odd jobs. Since all of this, he's been drinking exponentially more. He drinks Natty Daddy tall boys and he consumes anywhere from 6 to 12 a day. He drinks all hours of the day. Morning, night and in between. When he got a physical 2 years ago his liver SGOT was 328 when normal is 60. His upper abdomen is very bloated & he throws up often randomly. He won't go back to the doctor which I know it's because he knows what the outcome will be. If he doesn't have a drink, he gets violently ill. Throwing up, shaking, pale, cold sweats, diarrhea and super bad panic attacks.

That is just the physical effects. Mentally he's in a deep depression & has given up on everything. Except for our marriage. I'm an extremely supportive partner he knows I'm there for him always and in the past I've talked to him about using this time to go to rehab, while he doesn't really have any financial responsibility and I'm more than willing to hold it down while he gets professional help. At times he'll tell me he's sick of drinking and wants to just go detox & seek treatment but he hasn't taken that step yet.

At this point I feel completely defeated and powerless to this addiction. I'm not sure what else I can do but I'm open to any suggestions.",2020-07-30 03:24:10
I'm tired of not being believed,1,hyxrqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/hyxrqv/im_tired_of_not_being_believed/,1,1595903046.0,"A little background before I get into the story: my husband has been suffering from alcoholism for the past few years. When we first got together in 2013 he enjoyed partying, but not as severely as the past 2 years. Back in June 2019 my husband had his first bout of pancreatitis. He did ok for about 2 months, but then my father passed away due to cancer and it really affected my husband because he looked up to him. My husband started drinking heavily again and had another episode of pancreatitis around Thanksgiving. Again he quit for a bit but started spiraling down again due to his job stress and some Finacial issues we were facing. He had his last major attack back in February 2020. He has done amazing since then...he has had some slip ups here and there but no where near what he was drinking before hand and I and his brother have really seen him improve. Oh and one more thing before the story: my husband has 2 severe severe alcoholic uncles. One is recovering and has a lot of medical issues due to his abuse....and his other uncle is homeless due to his abuse. 

Now here's the reason for my title:
This past Friday my husband went to the ER for stomach pains. They took blood work and his pancreas levels were normal and they sent him home with a diagnosis of gastritis and told him to come back if the pain didn't get better. Saturday morning he goes back to the hospital again because he knew something was wrong and they did an ultrasound and did blood work again. His pancreas levels were again normal but this time they saw some gallstones on the ultrasound. They again sent him home with pain meds and told him to come back if it wasn't getting better. Saturday night rolls around and I have to bring him back to the ER. He was in severe pain almost crying and when they took blood work again and this time his pancreas levels were through the roof. I made it a fact to his family that this was not caused by his alcoholism. His recovering alcoholic uncle started yelling at me saying ""it's a lie...he's lying to you, when I took your dog for a walk he knocked over your trashcans and I found shooters and I found a receipt for a big bottle of fireball!!"" ( My husband and I believe he went through our trash because our garbage bags were tied!)! 

It just hurt so bad ( I should also mention that we have a 3 year old and one on the way, so when this happened I was emotionally raw from the stress of my husband not being home and the pregnancy). I was in the Er with my husband I heard what the doctors said...this episode they have no idea what caused it...could it have been the gallstones yes...was it because my husband started falling down a bad path again....maybe. It just hurts that his family doesn't believe us and are convinced that he is going to turn up like his homeless uncle.
